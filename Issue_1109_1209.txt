Issues 1109_1209:
-----------------------------------------
1. Summarize short gist of making scientific video in github 


2. Rough reading paper 

---
4.  First step, add the missing nodes to json


- Find the ori picture, in issues/temps,  in tif type


- Module 1's thresholding is in scikit-image
https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/auto_examples/segmentation/plot_multiotsu.html

- Module 2's watershed is also in scikit-image
https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/auto_examples/segmentation/plot_watershed.html
------------------------------


[v]4.1 read picture 

[v]4.2 use multiotsu to get two thresholds [add multiotsu]
	- divide in two part, this is threshold part
	- output threshold is nparray, not image

	- ref: https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/auto_examples/segmentation/plot_multiotsu.html

[v]4.3 digitize with threshold bins(digitize is to put value into bins and count number)
	
	- do we need to draw histogram as in ref or not 
	- part 2 of otsumulti
	
	
	- show regions in picture
	- why it can be shown, it's a image or numpy.array or no difference?
	

[??]  how to get thresholds[0] from threshold(an output array from node) in nodes

[v]4.4 numpy.greater					[add numpy.greater in float]

[?] - add externalImports in math package 
	- datatype of input is numpy.ndarray not float
	- ref : https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.greater.html#numpy.greater
	


from skimage import (
    color, feature, filters, measure, morphology, segmentation, util
)

[v]- measure.label, [ add measure.label in Scikit-segmentation]
	[?] - output labels is not image but numpy.array


[v] - .max [add numpy.max in float ] 
[v]- calculate dividing value [add numpy.divide in float]


[v]- print naive_mi [use log node]

[v]- write[cells] [dividing] as image

----

[v]4.5 numpy.greater [v]
	-manualley set higer threshold as 125

[v]4.6 filter.rank.mean [add filter.rank.mean in filter]
[v]	- add [util.img_as_ubyte in filter]
[v]	- add [morphology.disk in filter]   -in case it's difficult to use
		[?]- the input && return footprint is not image, is int and ndarray
	
	

[v]4.7 numpy.greater with mean  [use >]
	smoother_dividing > 20 get binary smoother_dividing

[v]4.8 measure.label (binary smoother_dividing) [use measure_label in segmentation]

[v]- [use .Max in float]
[v]- print better nuclei as ouput.module1 [use log]

----

[v]4.9 disttance calculation
	from scipy import ndimage as ndi
	[?] - output is ndarray or also image
	-ref: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.ndimage.distance_transform_edt.html

[v]4.10 feature.local max with distance
	- the distance we get from last step is input image
	[?] - output is ndarray coordinates not image
	-ref:  https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/api/skimage.feature.html#skimage.feature.peak_local_max

[v]4.11 mask with distance.shape  [add .shape, .zeros in float]

[??]4.12 tuple mask as true  [may try make a tuple node] 
	```

The `local_max_coords` array is then used to set the corresponding values 
in the `local_max_mask` array to `True`. 
The `tuple()` function is used to convert the `local_max_coords` array
 to a tuple of coordinates, which is then passed to the `[]` operator
 to index the `local_max_mask` array and set the corresponding values to `True`.


	```

[v]4.14 marker for watershed [use measure_label in segmentation]


[v]4.15 watershed and get the segemented cells as output.module2
	[!]- the first input is distance image
	[?] - the second parameter could be int or ndarray int
			-we use ndarray
	[?] - the third variable mask = cells, here cells is 
		# Step 4
			cells = image > thresholds[0]
	- ref: https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/api/skimage.segmentation.html#skimage.segmentation.watershed

[v]4.16 overlay the colored image to raw

[v]- color.label2rgb [add in color.label2rgb segmentation]

	- first parameter is the segemented_cells we get in Step 15
	- second is ori image
	
	- the 3rd and 4th parameter need to be set specifically 
	[?]	- {{{alpha=inputs.3}}},{{{bg_color=inputs.4}}} correct or not
	-ref :https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/api/skimage.color.html#skimage.color.label2rgb
-----

[v]4.17 
[use .max in float]
print ouput.module1/output.module2  [use / in float]

-------------------------------------------
Main task today:
1. Check how to make a research video

2. Check the direction of Paper

3. usecase 1 of segment cells






----------------------------------------------
My thoughts:

- Video Preview in CHI is 30s
- Sumpplemental material video is 5 mins 

- no hurry, simply copy and paste again
	- delete the wrong branch , make a new one
	-
