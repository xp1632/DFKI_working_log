Issues 1504_1604_1704:
-----------------------------------------
1. I am a little anxious right now 
so I learnt something about scientific writing
in https://github.com/xp1632/DFKI_working_log/issues/42

2. This morning I checked two tutorial about academic Resume and cover letter
	- https://github.com/xp1632/DFKI_working_log/issues/37
	- https://github.com/xp1632/DFKI_working_log/issues/43
	
3. Today I'll spit out a CV as if I am a mentor in an education agency.  
https://github.com/xp1632/DFKI_working_log/issues/37#issuecomment-2061960793
- What to modify in the CV?

- two pages, the second page is the project screenshot

- I modify the content in a very rough style
	- and leave the styles modification later

- I'll also add more content for hiwi work and master thesis work
	- and only slightly mention the two project before
	- Skills part would be really long
	- Education part I'll also list overall grade

- first academic CV in https://github.com/xp1632/DFKI_working_log/issues/37#issuecomment-2063586782

- first cover letter in 
https://github.com/xp1632/DFKI_working_log/issues/43






-------------------------------------------
Main task today:


(v) 1. Thesis Template and add my information

(v)2. Prepare scientific writing skills in  https://github.com/xp1632/DFKI_working_log/issues/42

(v)3. first version of academic cv
in https://github.com/xp1632/DFKI_working_log/issues/37#issuecomment-2063586782
(v)4. first complete version of cover letter
in 
https://github.com/xp1632/DFKI_working_log/issues/43#issuecomment-2063584359

5. fix postfix and multi-operation in code

My thoughts:

1. 【Feedback from material science field】

- His status
	- Tif format support
	- 3d view software from Franhofer https://www.3dflow.net/3df-zephyr-free/
	- hard to show and share workflow even for a simple workflow
---

- Feedback for VP project
	- documentation as comment for sharing 
	- need to process a series of image in the image folder
	- no clear helping information for handle name 
	- need loop? yes

	- now he's manually doing some functions he need 
	- now he's using script to simulate the manual process of click and process, and he can not do anything while this script runs

--- 

- question about input data format: 
	- want 3d images support
	- but process with 3d images slice also works
	
---
- His problem of segmentation:

	- now he's doing a lot of manual work to adjust the parameters of segmentation

	- want machine learning segementation features include instead of 
	simple threshold

- P Email Draft

- my version:

Hi Philipp, Hi Tim,

I am Ziwei He, a master student 

I am writing to apply for an PhD position in your group. Attached is my CV and transcrpt, the following is my short cover letter.

My strength: 

	- Working in a structured and professional manner(git link)
		- Just like the other works I did before joining this group, I treat hiwi work and master thesis also with a professional working attitude.
		- Problems are figured out and researched to find several solutions
		- Solutions are compared and a certain one is chosen for solid reasons
		- I always arrange my work in a structured way
		
		
	- Fast adaption to new research topic/new required skills
		- I majored in Software Engineering in bachelor so I have foudations of programming skills for C, Python, Java
		
		- But before I started hiwi job for Chaldene Visual Programming Project in ASR group, I don't have much experience in Typescript, React framework, Html, Css, so I took a coursera Web Development  track provided by Meta company and learnt them. https://coursera.org/share/e1e074fd479a591f633559f898726172
		
		- Before doing master thesis of Integrating Fiji into Chaldene, I know nothing about Fiji, but I went through most of its related materials after starting the topic and now I know Fiji
		
		- When some new skills are needed in a new topic, I just figure out what I need to know, learn it and use it.
		
		
	- Open to advices 
	
		- As a master student who lacks experience, I also met some problems I don't know how to deal with. Or some mistakes that I didn't notice myself.
		- Gladly I learnt a lot via weekly team meeting with Tim, Fei, Christian,and Sunita. 
		- I gathered and obsorbed their precious feedbacks on my thesis progress, which make me grow faster.
		
	- Good presentation skills
	
		- I believe presentation skills are also important for doing research.
		- A PhD student would meet many occasions that she/he need to present their work.
		- My trick is to prepare more and practice more.
		- I got grade 1.0 for the presentation part in Course Human Computer Interaction and Attentive User Interface.
		- And I really appreiciate your approbation on my thesis presentation.
		
	- Bring satisfactory outcome for both sides when doing interdisciplinart research.
	
		- `Integrating ImageJ image processing into Chaldene Visual Programming Syestem` , this topic is also a cross-section project between Material Science and Computer Science.
		- When volunteering in AIMSE 2023, I also communicated with the researchers in material science field, and carefully recorded their needs.
		- This is why I love bringing satisfactory outcome for in

- project-orient research, under your supervision
