My thoughts:

- What code should we include in the appendix of thesis?

   - the oneNode one and the Batch_multiOperation one, 

- what should we submit to the cloud system?

	- the oneNode one and the Batch_multiOperation one, and the imageJ package
	
v - only batch one is enough, I am tired of modifying another file	

- The work permit application for Luxembourg is normally 30 days
