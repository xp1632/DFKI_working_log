Issues 2207_2307:
-----------------------------------------
1. The mouse is kind of annoying before but is working normally now

- we'll start with the easy ones:
- inserting references for Chapter 4 method and chapter 5 result

- also figuring out the page head and foot

- that's it for the forenoon


1.1 we've finished the reference for the whole paper

1.2 Now we are going to edit 4 places in the abstract

- mention the non-computer science researcher at the begining and lead to image, refering to the paragraph in chapter Intro but a condensed version

- simplify `what process`? how simplified?

- not various integration methods, but state the polyglot Jupyter notebook explicitly

- borrow some fancy words also from Intro chapter or maybe result chapter
	- make sure use the best phraise in Abstract
	

2. Missing goals in 4.1.3

We notice a missing point at the end of 4.1.3

chapter 4.1.3 Furthermore, this approach fails to meet our goal of lowering the barriers for scientists confined to ImageJ by leveraging additional Python libraries

- we use this reseason to change the RQ but we didn't mention it in abstract and intro

- i can say this is the side contribution






-------------------------------------------
Main task today:

1. Modify the content in abstract and intro

2. Add reference in Result and Method


3. When you are about to leave school, take the bachelor stuffs to lib
and scan it to the usb

- Or, we scanned it in dfki with high dpi

4. We also want to write a letter by ourselves to examination office

such as: 

We hereby recoginized Ziwei He,2564549, studying Mediainformatics,
have fulfilled all gradution requirements except for handing in final master thesis.

----------------------------------------------
My thoughts:

v - today, I'll scan the bachelor documents, first in dfki
	- if it doesn't look good, then in lib before I leave school
	

v - tomorrow morning, i'll get a letter from study coordinator
- and scan it, send it in both application system in lux and to adrian

- if I didn't get a reply from examination office until afternoon.

v - then book a termin of 25th and send an email to Adrian

--------------------------------------------
Take away:

- We'll give the new positions until Thursday because I like them better and they also reply in a fast manner


- we'll submit the progress of thesis on Thursday

- the first version is also the your presumed last version

- only add the appendix in the final version? 
	- or already add it
