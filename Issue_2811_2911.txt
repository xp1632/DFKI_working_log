Issues 2811_2911:
-----------------------------------------

1. I found a ImageJ1, ImageJ2 equivalent api table in 
https://github.com/Max-ChenFei/VPE_IP/issues/40

v 2. I am checking the howto-java-imagej tutorial code : 
https://github.com/imagej/tutorials/tree/master/java/howtos/src/main/java/howto/app

- in app folder,we have GetJARsInClassPath:
https://github.com/imagej/tutorials/blob/master/java/howtos/src/main/java/howto/app/GetJARsInClassPath.java
	- which let us check the avaible jars in classpath
	- I tried it in jupyetr and it returns beakerx related jars
	- not imagej jars or our plugin jars that add via %classpath

3. I checked the `install` command in Fiji, 
it uses imagej1's plugin :

`legacy:ij.plugin.PluginInstaller` to install the plugin to Fiji
- how should we use it in Jupyter?
- what's inside the class: 
	https://imagej.net/ij/developer/api/ij/ij/plugin/PluginInstaller.html

- we don't use it, because it requires javac compliler
- we register the plugin mannually by addPlugin()
	
4. I'll start checking adding ops in imageJ both from java and notebook now
https://github.com/Max-ChenFei/VPE_IP/issues/42





-------------------------------------------
Main task today:


1. Op notebook/java summary 
2. test the plugin in jupyter
	v - test with the explicit code plugin 
	v  - test with the jar plugin

3. v test plugin in IDE: `run java` for test run; `mvn package` for build jar 

4. v test the plugin in local fiji
	v - I installed the jar in Plugins>Install 
		- restart fiji
		- and find my plugin GaussianFilter at the bottom
		- after open a img in the context 
		- I run the plugin
		- and got filtered pictures
---

- after modify the plugin itself according to copliot answers of print out
- result to jupyter

- we could move on to, how to know what errors might occur when customized plugin
comes
- and how should we give proper feedback







----------------------------------------------
My thoughts:

- For final process, considering the target user of our software,

	- I'll offter a usecase of material's segmentation
	- and a biology cell counting





--------------------------------------------
Take away:

- on around Dec 5.6, we are going to do paper stuffs
- including usecase in paper, update video
