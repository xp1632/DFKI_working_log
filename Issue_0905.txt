Issues 0905:
-----------------------------------------
1.Modify the padding of MenuItem 
 -The extra left padding from MeneItem is removed
 -The extra top/bottom padding also need to be removed
	- the padding is changed to 2px as in jupyter
  
 
2.Change the size and padding of SVG ICON
- size to 16x16px

3.Change the size of listitem or menu item to make it longer
-the width of listitemtext is set to 256px

4.Add the cutting line between the iconed item and the last 'Break Node Link' item
-Its called divider in MUI 

5.decrease the shadow of the menu edge -not important

6.change the font size of text
font size- 15px

7. Add the underline for first Letter -not important

8. Color of right side text to black 

9. Check the usage of typography
https://mui.com/material-ui/api/typography/

10. Check the referce table of name of props in CSS and MUI
https://mui.com/system/properties/

11. Check the legend in MUI

1 spacing equals 8 pixel
-------
<Button sx={{ mb: 3 }} />

// is equivalent to
<Button sx={{ marginBottom: theme => theme.spacing(3)}} />
-------
equals in CSS
.my-class {
  margin-bottom: 24px;
}
-------

12. change MUIlist width to make the menu more square-like
<MenuList> 's width is set as 230px

14. Check TreeView in MUI https://mui.com/material-ui/react-tree-view/

15. The structure of Search menu is a little complicated
- It seems to have a struture(top to bottom) of 
   [SearchMenu-> SearchedTreeView-> StyledTreeItem -> TreeItem]
   
Need to find the correct place to add styling
In StyledTreeItem.tsx, <StyledTreeItem>--><Box>--><Typography>


-------------------------------------------
Main task today:

1. Mock  the exact style of Jupyter's context menu
 -make the right margin of text same as the left
 -shorter in width in whole 
 -text of ctrl , the same with jupyter menu
 
 -set the top/bottom padding of the MenuList to 4px
 -force the fontSize to 15px
 
2. Search Menu
 -Add Typography to text in order to keep same font and size
	-Need to find TreeItem
	-In StyledTreeItem.tsx, <StyledTreeItem>--><Box>--><Typography> change font
	-In StyledTreeItem.tsx, <StyledTreeItem>--><Box> change padding
	
 -Remove extra spaces at the bottom of the search menu 
	-But not too small ,better 'auto' in height
		-set <TreeView> 's sx as height:'auto' in SearchedTreeView.tsx
		-set maxHeight to 230px
		
	-because the items in the tree view coudl be a lot 
	
 - consider adding two icon before 'Add Comment' 'Add Reroute'

----------------------------------------------
My thoughts:

1. Now when we have multiple MeneItem,
and we would like to change the style of it,
we change it multiple times in different places
It's hard to maintain the code in this way

-Better create a theme to make the code more concise.
- We could parameterise the theme after we have an initial version

2. Also If we have a lot of requirements in customizing style,
is it better that we use the Basic UI that privide by MUI
then we do not need to spend a lot of time in removing the paddings from default MUI style 
 
 -Check Basic MUI, next step
 
	2.1. I find an easier way to remove default paddings
		for example in MeneItem https://mui.com/material-ui/api/menu-item/
		-we have dense(bool) prop for dense padding designed for keyboard
		-and disableGutter(bool) prop to remove left,right padding
	
3. Is it okay that the padding and font are set with pixel?
When zoom in and zoom out, it might cause problems

-No problem

--------------------------------------------
Take away:

1. The padding : 2 and padding:"2px" is different in MUI,
	MUI uses theme.spacing, 1 default spacing is 8 px
	https://mui.com/system/properties/#legend
	
2. parameterise the style later when we have a initial version

3. Only give access to the data that we don't want to hide from the user

4. Commit when one unit function is finished , keep lastest version with server

-----
Tomorrow:

Add icon or reduce the left padding space to 'Add Comment' the menu
