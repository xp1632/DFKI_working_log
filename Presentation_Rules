### [Cognitive Workload]
- Pay attention to the cognitive workload bias for audience and presenter
- Don't provide too much information both visually and acousically within short time,

### [Presenting Source Code]
**Two solutions for presenting source code:**
- Pause/explain and highlight the code for the audience to understand for codes that are important;
- Or blur the code that you don't want the audience to read line by line.

### [Citation]
  - Remember to cite the source of image or workflow in the seminar slides

### [Handling Questions during the presentation]
	- If questions emerge during presentation, ask the audience if she/he wants to discuss now for 4 mins
	- or discuss in the end('I am happy to discuss etc'), to keep the 20mins punctuality

### [What's a good presentation start or ending?]
  - a.Take the stage by raising the voice at the beginning, as a reminder for everyone else
  - b.Start with a confident and firm attitude : 'Good afternoon everyone! I am Ziwe He, today I am
	presenting my master thesis seminar: xxxxxxxxx'
  - c.End with a doubtless attitude: 'As a summary, I'll conclude my work as xxxx. With this method,
	we xxxxxxx.  Thank you very much and I am happy to take questions now!'

### Careful with color combination such as yellow+green
- a. with different projector setting, might be hard to distinguish
- b. also could cause trouble for color blind people

### [How to keep the dynamic in the presentation?]
    - instead of reading written scripts
	- a.Practice presentation without any scripts in empty room or in mind
	- b.Pick up the good spontanous sentences and recite them 
	- c.Do it several times, and form your own `spontaneous` scripts in mind
	- d.Also, keep eye contact with audience to see if they're convinced or lost
		- tell or omit the rest 20% dynamic content based on their reaction
