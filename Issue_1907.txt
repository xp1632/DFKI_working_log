Issues 1807:
-----------------------------------------
1. Line 446 in useGraph

	-useCallback with empty dependency means 
	this function would only be recreated once when the components mounts
 
	1.1 our isValidConnection():
	-we take Connection from reactflow and return action and message 
	-there's rules for validConnection
		-datatype, source, target,maxConnection,

	-the isValidConnection in reactflow takes edge and return boolean
	
	1.2  getHandleConnectionCounts()
	-we take nodeId and handleId, return the counts of handle

	
	1.4 isAnyConnectableNodeSelected()
	-return boolean by finding if a node has both input and output and is selected
	1.4.1 anyConnectableNodeSelected and its setState used the boolean in 1.4

	1.4.2 anyConnectionToSelectedNode to see if selectedNode has connnection by
	checking if their inputs or outputs handles has handle.connection
	

	1.5 toString  graph as obejct {nodes,edges} to JSON string
		serializer used

	1.6 fromJSON graph as SerializedGraph to {nodes,edges}

2. useScene
	0. we have ISceneActions and ISceneState

3.useGui, click, openWidget, closeWidget, and most important!!! Command is defined here

4. useKeyDown keydown and trigger spefic scene actions]

5. useTrackMousePos hook, get projected Pos of mouse

-------------------------------------------
Main task today:


1. Continue the code reading in Line 446 in VP project useGraph

2. Part 1 's lebenstest question




----------------------------------------------
My thoughts:







--------------------------------------------
Take away:

1.-useCallback with empty dependency means 
	this function would only be recreated once when the components mounts

2.-difference of getNode and getNodes is: one is to get one, another is to get many
