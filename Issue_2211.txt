Issues 2211:
-----------------------------------------

- Today I attend tha AIMSE conference as a volunteer

- This conference is about application of machine learning  
- in the area of marterial science

- 1. Present side summary

- the key of a good pre is :

- Timing, good presenter put a timer at the table to be punctual
- Voice: reading without tone changes is bad, try to use pause, emphasize and questioning
- Content: it's good to have a conclusion page that states the challengs/problems/methods
- Form: chart is good, image is good, animation is really good, too much text is bad
- Architecture of a pre: 
	- old story of old ways;
	- basic concept for different backgrounds
	- current challenges;
	- method1;
	- usecase 1;
	- method2; 
	- usecase 2;
	- comparision using chart
	- adavantages 

- 2. Material side summary

- Field challenges when applying ai to material dataset:

	- the industry process is complex, which lead to non-unified format of dataset
	- the data is hard to collect 
	- identification of parameters 
	- the correlation of parameters is hard to find
	- current data could lead to graphs/charts but no semantic info/diagnose
	
	
- Tools: 
	- for material scientist, they use fiji software and existing NN models
	- for cs backgrounds, they use python and label me etc.

- Image Processing method they value:

	- segmentation	(segmenation of grains in cross section of steels/cells- cellpose)
	- object detection (for voids, cracks in material) 
	- classfication
	- 3d reconstruction based on 2d texture of material
	
- Industry field they value more cost and time
