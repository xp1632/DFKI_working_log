Issues 0606:
-----------------------------------------
1. First we need to carefully deal with the gui module:
	because the accordinon and menu are all in this module,
	now we might not only deal with tunnel 1 like yesterday, wo deal
	with assets in it and carefully fix both tunnels
	
	-project layer index.css ---tunnel 1-->module layer index.css-
	tunnel 2---> assets layer sx
	
	-Accordion first
	-Then Menu

2. Accordion: 
	-we defined some css variables insided NodeLibrary.tsx
	-if we want the gui/index.css to control it
		-should we define it first in index.css
		-and just use it inside it?
			-Yes, we can do that
			-we delete the css styles that we declare and defined in react components
			-move it to module/index.css
			-and only use it in react components
		
		-will we need to modify accordinon and menu
			-Yes, the icon size, the font size, color, we'll need to modify it
		

2.1 We first deal with Accordion Item

2.2 Then we deal with NodeLibraryList , and we'll delete NodeLibraryList.css and 
move it elsewhere
	-The fontSize inside the Accordion Summary needs addition



3.Menu: Now we deal with Menu
	-Border radius for menu is finished
	-We need to add support for font color, size
	-Hovereffect
	-the search bar's size
	
	-There's problem about minHeight of the menu, the default height seems to 
	be 48px, we need to change that
	
	-Also, menu we have tree-view menu and normal menu
		-Searched treeview is not hard, we just need to add support for 
		
	-Now the problem occers only on normal menu
		-We fix this first
		-Before it's because I change the zooming in the explore,
		-after reloading, and set the window to normal 100%
		-The problem seems to disappear?
			-But the font becomes really small, because the title part didn't 
			add a specific Typography container, so it applied the default root style 
			from MUI
	-Now the size problem is solved, we need to add color, size, icon size to the menu
	
3.1 Normal Menu is finished, now we move on to tree-view menu

Tree-view menu:

	-Search bar, two icon, font-size
	-tree icon
	-font color, size

4. We'll add support for icon size at last after modules are finished
	-iconsize for normal menu is added
	-the icon in sticky nodes,
	-on the minimap needs further

Take away:

1. how should we add self-defined css properties in react component's typescript
without external css file?
	-we first declare a CSSProperties interface for react module:
	-----
	declare module 'react' {
	  interface CSSProperties {
		'--vp-accordion-item-border-color'?: string;
		'--vp-accordion-item-title-font-size'?: string;
	  }
	}
	-----
	-the in one parent element in return(),
	we define the value of css properties:
	
	----
	return(
		<li
		style ={{
		
		'--vp-accordion-item-border-color': 'var(--vp-gui-font-color)',
        '--vp-accordion-item-title-font-size': '15.5px',
		
		}}
		>
		...
