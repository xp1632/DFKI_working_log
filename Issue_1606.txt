Issues 1606:
-----------------------------------------
1. I start with index.tsx in src
	I checked App() and the root

The most top component is <MainArea>

2. In <MainArea>,we have components:
	///-Progress _MUI
	-NodeLibraryList
	///-InPlaceTextArea
	-Three buttons
	/-A regular textarea
	-VPEditor

3. /// is the components that is not quite useful

4. In <NodeLibraryList>
	-three functions are defined
		-onUninstall 
		-onDisable
		-onEnable
	which are clearly defined for buttons inside the 
	accordion
	
5. Three buttons:

	-Load deafult:
		-setActivated(true)
		-setContent(deepCopy example) here the type 
		of example is Serializedgraph
		
	-Clear:
		-setActivated(false)
		-setContent(undefined)
	
	-Clear 2 (I don't quite understand the difference of
	these two clears)
		-sceneActions.clear()

6.The regular textarea
	shows the changedCount of <VPEditor>

7. <VPEditor> has:

	-id
	-content
	-onContentChange() //Count the number of change
	-activated
	-onSceneActionsInit() //Not sure about functions
	-onSelectionChange
	-option
	
	

		
		
		
		
-------------------------------------------
Main task today:

1. Read the project code from top index.tsx
	-get the relation of different component
	-Better have a graph
