Issues 1303_1403_1503:
-----------------------------------------
1. we'll continue the backgound+ Motivation part

 - The notes under it can be written in the end
 - but the basic version of sentences on the slide page should be meaningful
 

2. The [background] is already quite close

- just add the key sentences you want to show on slides
- and not so key sentences in the notes

[v] 2.1 Background - ImageJ/Fiji

---

- I checked the `supplementary pdf` JIPipe provides in 
 https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41592-022-01744-4/MediaObjects/41592_2022_1744_MOESM1_ESM.pdf
 
- where it compared itself with KNIME and some other visual programming tool
- it is useful but currently too complicated for me

---
[v] 2.2 Background - Chaldene

---
[v] Motivation illstrated by intersection and challenges

---

3. Now we're heading to [Methodology] Part

- I plan to provide it as a `menu`: 

- Theoritical needs and reference papers (vegetables)
- Result (juicy meat) (Progress Made)
- twist conflicts (sauce) 

-------
[v][IJava Kernel Menu] --- starter menu

- Theoritical needs and reference papers (vegetables)
- Result (juicy meat) (Progress Made)
- twist conflicts (sauce) 
  |
  v
------
[PyImageJ Menu]  --- menu that fed you up

- new methods
- Result 
- twist conlicts
------
  |
  v

[Auto Op conversion Menu]  --- surprise dessert

- graphical theory
- go live_yum yum result (prepare for two nodes and somehow clean the lab a bit)

Hi Tim, hi Fei, these are quick summaries for today's feedback:   

--------      
【General Presenetaion Feedback】:

- 1. Keep the dynamic in the presentation instead of totally reading written scripts
	[Method]:
	
	- a.Practice presentation without any scripts in empty room or in mind
	- b.Pick up the good spontanous sentences and recite them 
	- c.Do it several times, and form your own `spontanous` scripts in mind
	- d.Also, keep eye contact with audience to see if they're convinced or lost
		- tell or omit the rest 20% dynamic content based on their reaction

- 2. How to make a good start and end for presentation?

	- a.Take the stage by raising the voice at the beginning, as a reminder for everyone else
	- b.Start with a confident and firm attitude : 'Good afternoon everyone! I am Ziwe He, today I am
	presenting my master thesis seminar: xxxxxxxxx'
	- c.End with a doubtless attitude: 'As a summary, I'll conclude my work as xxxx. With this method,
	we xxxxxxx.  Thank you very much and I am happy to take questions now!'

- 3. Considering color blind people ,different settings of projector and display when determing
the color palette, avoid green and yellow etc.

-----
【Specific Slide Feedback】:

- 1. Deleting [Outline] page because we already have a clear structure and a fluent storyline

- 2. In Slide 2 [Background - Fiji], advertise more about Fiji
	- tell more about its material sciences/ astronomy field community
	- and more than 30000 people who are using Fiji 800+ plugins
	- stress more on why Fiji is super cool and why we want to integrate it

- 3. In Slide 3 [Background - Chaldene], add two explanatory sentences
	- about what is VP workflow, what is visual node
	- visual node is functioning backended by node specification json file
	- don't mention hiwi work

- 4. In Slide 4 [Motivation -Comparison]
	- In both sides,remove the [user friendly] comparison since its not our main focus
	- In Fiji side, illstrate more on `hard to share workflow`
		a. Add [Inconvenience in Macro recorder to reproduce workflow]: 
		- still requires knowledge of scripts editing
		- works for exact obejct in exact order, hard to extend 
	- In Chaldene side, illstrate more `easy to share and visualize`
		a. Add [Visual Automation Workflow] 
		b. Add [Digital Sustainbility], [Scientific reproducibility]

- 5. In Slide 28 [Next Step]
	- say it in a more abstract level
	- mention that we'll do some wrap work for the automation pipeline
	- might wrap it into a special GUI in Chaldene
	- And for Knowledge Graph part, also an important part of Chaldene,
	- the only reason we didn't touch it now is that this part of project is still
	in progress by other group members, we want to integrate our part of work later.

### let's first modify the slides, not the notes

[] 1.In Slide 2 [Background - Fiji], advertise more about Fiji
	- tell more about its material sciences/ astronomy field community
	- and more than 30000 people who are using Fiji 800+ plugins
	- stress more on why Fiji is super cool and why we want to integrate it




-------------------------------------------
Main task today:

(v)1. Summarize the feedbacks for slides
2. Modify the feedback parts and have a version 2
3. Finish the conclusion part and next step part


----------------------------------------------
My thoughts:

- Possible Questions:

- How do you summarize your contribution?
