Issues 0805:
-----------------------------------------
0. After pull the project
DO NOT npm audit after npm install the environment

1. Delete CR in every end of line
Solved in git bash :
git config --global core.autocrlf false
Then pull the project again

2. Why the code is in Typescript instead of JS?
TS is a superset of JS, which can define the datatype

-Learn high-level knowledge of TS https://blog.csdn.net/gao511147456/article/details/125809525
-Example code of TS 
<script type="text/typescript">
	var hw:string="Hello World!";
	document.write(<h1>"+hw+"<h1>);
</script>

3. Tortoise Git
How to use it

4. Jupterlab 
-How to install:
install in cmd 
pip install jupyterlab

-How to start 
type in cmd
jupyter lab

5.Getting to know the project

Find the code location of Context Menu by dev Tool
-Found the div and class of context menu but we need to find the code that generate the elements

Found the gui/EdgeMenu.tsx to generate the menu
-Need to find where to modify the css code, because MUI styles seem to wrapped in pre-defined component <Menu/> 

Check the custimization in MUI website to find out where to modify the size and padding etc.
-found the way to custimize style of component
example code:
--------------------
import Button from '@mui/material/Button';
import { styled } from '@mui/material/styles';

const CustomButton = styled(Button)({
  // your custom styles go here
}) as typeof Button;
---------------------

Another way to modify the menu is to use the internall parameter
[sx]

6. How to modify Menu component in MUI:

-<MenuList dense> when the list is long
-<Paper sx={{ width: 320, maxWidth: '100%' }}>  to change width

Main task today:

0. Learn Basic TS to understand the project code: https://blog.csdn.net/gao511147456/article/details/125809525

0.5 Learn MUI fast and know its useful component,such Menu
	-to understand menu component, go through https://mui.com/material-ui/react-menu/ 
	-to understand sx props, go through https://mui.com/system/getting-started/the-sx-prop/
	-to understand list component,go through https://mui.com/material-ui/react-list/

1. take the style of jupterlab's context menu and extensions as reference


2. modify the style in four context menu
	The four context menus are
	-Background menu(search menu)
	-Node menu
	-Node point menu(handle menu)
	-Node line menu(edge menu)
	
	
----------------------------------------------
My thoughts:

1. The interactivity of line and nodepoint are not obvious, more hints need to be added
- such as in https://mui.com/material-ui/react-progress/ to show the functioning line with animation
- Or hovering effect

2.Snack bar could be a good hint for telling the state of node 
https://mui.com/material-ui/react-snackbar/

3. Tooltip is also a good way for hint of specific small functioning
https://mui.com/material-ui/react-tooltip/

Take away:
-Use dev tool to locate more
-use !important to apply some rules first
