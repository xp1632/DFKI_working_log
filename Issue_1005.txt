Issues 1005:
-----------------------------------------
1. Check SVGIcons in MUI https://mui.com/material-ui/material-icons/
	-How to add icon
		For reroute Icon, import RouteIcon from '@mui/icons-material/Route';
		For comment Icon, import CommentIcon from '@mui/icons-material/Comment';
	
	-where to add Icon for search menu
		We need to modify the StyledTreeItem.tsx
		- How to only modify specific items in the tree
			-check the example in official website https://mui.com/material-ui/react-tree-view/	
			-The customization example and gmail clone example might work
			-The customization example work for customization of same EndIcon, ExpandIcon, not suitable in our case
			
			-The gmail clone example that each item has a different icon works
				just apply different icons for different treeitem
				<StyledTreeItem nodeId="1" labelText="All Mail" labelIcon={MailIcon} />
			
			-Now we need to find where we should add this in our code
				-Before we modify the <StyleTreeItemRoot/> in StyledTreeItem
					But it add same icon to every item includs parent and children
				- In SearchTreeView.tsx, however, we find function renderTreeItem
					It has different behavior for item.root and item.children
			
			
	-What kind of Icon we're using now?
		We are using Icon in filled style
	
 
1.1 Check IconButton in MUI https://mui.com/material-ui/api/icon-button/


2. modify SearchInput
	-Change the padding 
	in SearchInput.tsx, function SearchInput 
	we modify the padding in <Input> to top right bottom left(4px,0px,0px,4px)
	
	-Change the Icon in SearchBar
	we noticed that it's a tenrnary expression input? ClearButton :SearchButton
	The ClearButton is wrapped in <IconButton> while SearchButton not
	
	The style of both ClearButton and SearchButton are set as 
	sx={{ width: '20px', marginRight: '-4px', paddingBottom: '2px' }}
	

3. Check API for Treeitem :https://mui.com/material-ui/api/tree-item/

4. Check interface in Typescript https://typescript.bootcss.com/interfaces.html
-Interfaces defines the shape of type for certain value
-? means optionally

TreeItemData defines interface with id,name that is must-have
here id is NodeId, name is labelText

5. In function nodeConfigToTreeItemData()
we return treeItemData and here we define if a treeItem has children
based on its children.length, if the length>0 then children, else undefined

6.To set different icon for 'Add Comment' Item
	-I would like to modify in SearchedTreeView.tsx renderTreeItem
	-add if else based on labelText we get from item:TreeItemData
	-and set labeIcon accordingly as in <StyledTreeItem nodeId="1" labelText="All Mail" labelIcon={MailIcon} />

【】Another way is to modify a higher level interface, which is TreeItemData,
We add labelIcon prop to it and also add the labelIcon to
its related function commandsToTreeData

7.Check Overflow-x https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow-x
	-when overflowX is auto, the default scroll bar should be hidden
	-however ours is not hidden, the reason is we have horizontal paddings 
	  in MenuItem, which is beyond the range of X-axis
	-Thus we need to shorten TreeItem
	-Or enlarge the default menu 
	
	 -Also maybe the padding is caused by the search bar on top,
	 but when we changed the width of search bar, the x scoller bar still exist
	 
	【】Solevd: The padding is from the theme of styled function in StyledTreeItemRoot
	in StyleTreeItem.tsx, set the paddingRight:theme.spacing(0),paddingLeft:theme.spacing(0)
	
	We add some padding to icon in SearchedTreeView.tsx, <TreeView>
	
-------------------------------------------
Main task today:

1. Search Menu
	-Modify the searchinput component
	-Add icon or reduce the left padding space to 'Add Comment' the menu 
	-hide the overflowX scorll bar in default and show it when needed

2. NodeExtension component styling as in jupyter

----------------------------------------------
My thoughts:







--------------------------------------------
Take away:

1. First define what's the problem, then check is there official API,
 is there similar usecase/example in official website that we can modify
 
 2. A & in TS in the context of a types means an intersection type.
It merges all properties of 2 object types together and creates a new type

3.Abstract the if-else to upper interface and add attribute there is a better way
for object-oriented coding

4. Use search(ctrl shift f)
/find all references more instead of scanning the code by your eyes

------------------------
Tomorrow:

Edge Menu Margin
NodeExtension
