Issues 2808:
-----------------------------------------
1.we can divide this task into:

	- how do we get the handles of each nodeï¼Ÿ
		-get nodes's get handle
		
	- how do we highlight it?
		-add a classname and a style class for matching handles


2. we first go through handles of the node
	- where this code locate?
	- In VPEditor.tsx 's onConnectStart
	- i would like to define this into a sceneAction
	- Or the function we use in Search Menu could be put into Scene Action
	

3. When we get the handle, how do we locate the handle and add a className to it?

- how to locate a handle?
- our handle is different from RF handle becasue our handle is combined with node
	
	-for RF handle, handle is a element that has id,className,style 
	
	

4. Remeber, we also need to move highlight after the connectFinished or context Menu

-----------------------------------------------------------
not planned for that issue, we are starting fiji
-----------------------------------------------------------


5. Fiji has update to ImageJ2, this is the new feature of ImageJ2:










-------------------------------------------
Main task today:

1. (not planned)Highlight all mactched handles when dragging edge

2.  Check Fiji software functions
	2.1 check the user functions of Fiji
		-it's a scientific image PS, with some other functions such as script etc.
	2.2 check new features of ImageJ2





----------------------------------------------
My thoughts:







--------------------------------------------
Take away:

1. the config/setting file we mentioned before:
	is to add node by defining JSON file manually
	- if we could get parameters from Fiji's API then we could generate the nodes automatically

2. the python-fiji extension in Jupterlab now used python-binding
Python bindings allow you to call functions and pass data from Python to C or C++

we would like to use a java Kernel to run fiji directly
