Issues 0807:
-----------------------------------------
1. What do we want to tell the reader in the intro?

- what's this paper briefly about
	- what's the research question behind 
- brief background of both side
- why this work important 

- build the text from the result 

2. We should start the page from ImageJ ,because chaldene is unknown

	- we could refer to how we do the background in the slides

Main task today:
1. Watch Intro video

2. Unlike previous chapter, we'll also do correct reference for Introduction chapter since it's a text-focused chapter
(if it's really annoying, leave the placeholder for the reference)

3. We'll have four paragraphs in Chapter 1

- we first write the skeleton of each paragraph referring another master thesis

- then we start by writing the first paragraph

My thoughts:

1. sadly we are going to use the word reference as it's more steady while mendeley is so stupid

2. Good news is that, discussion and conclusion are normally short
