Issues 2007:
-----------------------------------------
1. Find where's the position for search menu

	-we have anchorPosition in SearchMenu,
 
	-we also have useMousePosition hook

2. Where' the addNode in SeachMenu from?
	-is it the same addNode as in useScene?
	-SeachMenu's addNode is in the action of Command
	-Command is defined in useGui

	-the mother addNode is from ISceneActions in useScene

3. The problem occurs when we create node on Keyboard when mouse is far away
	
	-we need to give Menu anchorPosition to addNode, and somehow convert it
	-the convert is finished

	3.2 How to get the domRef of reactflow in SearchMenu?
		or do we need it in this way?

	Yes, it's about different origins. 
	https://github.com/xp1632/DFKI_working_log/issues/12
	

	3.3 I need to figure out what do we get back from the bouding blabla function
	
	the getBoudingClientRect() returns the size and position of a rectangle.
	https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect
	we use it to move the origin of coordinates, see more in github issue in 3.2

4. How do we finally get the reactflow DOMreference?
	-at first, we don't want to import it to SearchMenu
		because SearchMenu should be a self-contained front view
	-but we need the reactflow root dom, to recalculate the coordinate we need in the scene

	-how should we do it?
	
	-we find out the reactflow reference is defined and used in VPEditor
	-And, we passed some mouse information from VPEditor to useScene hook
	-and useScene is also the place we defined the scene actions to AddNode()
	
	-useScene as a third party, seems to be a perfect place to recalculate the coordinate
	
	-----------
	-In more advanced version, we takes the same calculating part from mouseevent Calculation 
	and keydownEvent Anchor calculation
	-and we define a new function in utils, this function is exactly used as calculation,
	then pass the projected coordinate out for further usage

	-during the procedure, we also need to pass some functions here and there,
	-but don't be afraid to pass things around, the functions are defined to be called here and there
	when needed


-------------------------------------------
Main task today:

1. pass mousePosition or search Menu position to addNode

2. Check useRef

3. Context of Search Menu, or auto find port







----------------------------------------------
My thoughts:

1. Leben questions P1 tomorrow





--------------------------------------------
Take away:

1. Coordinate of web, 
o----------->x/left
