Issues 1008_1108:
-----------------------------------------
1. How to modify the onBlur event for CreatFunction?

- in Widgets.tsx or in CreateFunction?
- I think in both, because we do the basic in Widgets.tsx and value-related in CreateFunction


- I need to figure out, the parent- child relation of TextInput in Widgets
-From parent to child the relation is
 
 --[CreateFunction]--> [ParemeterHandle] -->[TextInput]
 
1.1 Need to figure out how the prop is triggered and passed 
-And the event order is:

-I kind of don't want to read and understand the event order of it


1.2 I want onChange to save tempValue, and only pass this tempValue onBlur
- before we just save it somewhere

1.4 We want the pool in CreateFunction
- and we can update the pool in ParemeterHandle's onBlur

-which means we have the access of Pool and setPool in CreateFunction's child-->ParemeterHandle

1.5 Do we need a UniqueNamePool, which link respect handleNames to its reference?

- We may need that, because what we modified now is just one node during the creation
- we may not need that, because the namePool is seperated from different node

1.6 How should we delete the name that has been modified in textInput?
- we set the oldVar and filter it

[!]1.7 Delete the handleName from Pool after deleting the handle 

	- To make sure after deleting, the deleted handle's title is also deleted
	-should run through the node to set a new handleNamePool when the handle is added or deleted
	
	
[1.8] To set the old, we kind of need to put the check duplication from updateHandlePool
back into Handler


1.9 I would like to rename some parameters

1.10 Should validate duplication and updateHandlePool be two seperated functions?

-yes, I'll have two functions now

-where should we check the duplication?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2 I missed two parts when solving this question:

2.1 I don't need a pool to save the name, I could just run through handleData

2.2 one importent thing is that, since we create the titleInput inside ParemeterHandle by

giving it handleData.title , thus this is the origin of 'value' we see in onChange

-thus, when we want like the textInput to show different 'value', we should also change 
from the origin, which is the handleData when createtion


-so what we should do it when onBlur, in handleBlur in CreateFunction

-2.3 where should handleBlur locate, what we do in onBlur?

1. check if the current input value is duplicated with all handles in this Node
2. how should we know which handle, which original value?
3. Or just ignoreï¼Ÿ but when ignore, how to update to original value?

2.4 Now we may have two question, why newValue is old value?


-Now the onChange would updated to title immediatly because we call setNode in handleChange

-why, when we enter new_out_2, the value in onBlur(value)'s value is still new_out_1?
it should be new_out_2 of our edit, we didn't save this new_out_2?

-because the value we passed inside TextInput from ParemeterHandle is not updated
-we could we useEffect to update when the value changes




-------------------------------------------
Main task today:

1. onEnter or onBlur, update the title

2. A array [] to save  the handle names in a creatFunction Node

3. give the oldVar back to setTempValue and update the TextInput again




----------------------------------------------
My thoughts:







--------------------------------------------
Take away:

1. To solve the question, start with 'small knife',
	if the 'small knife' can not fullfill the requirement
		then update the tool by using more complex external library
		

2. when we have both if and else to set the State
	use the setState(passingProp)
	or setState(!passingProp)
	or setState(!!passingProp) instead to keep simplicity
