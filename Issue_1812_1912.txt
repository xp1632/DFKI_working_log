1. cloud workflow integrates Fiji paper summary
Main contribution is software-container and cloud computing

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-19173-w

- The modular platform supports reproducible image analysis workflow
	by providing interactive graphics supports to software containers

- 3D Medical images are in large scale, thus it requires cloud computing 
	to eliminate the need for access to expensive, dedicated local servers 

- Biodepot-workflow-builder (Bwb) uses software containers represented by graphical widgets 
	to precisely define the version and operating environment for each module.

- Software containers greatly expand the scope of analyses possible, 
	as modules are no longer restricted to a pre-defined software suite. 

- Software containers also facilitate cloud deployment, 
	allowing users to easily scale the analysis for large datasets using on-demand cloud resources.

Their Fiji limitation:
- lack systematic version control, difficult to reproduce workflows' marco
- designed for desktop, interactive, not for cloud

---
Other workflow systems with a GUI limitation:

- KNIME Analytics Platform: built on Eclipse, not containerized

Main task today:

1. Go over the previous 3 log 
	- pick the useful part
	- close it

2. Wind up the Stage 1.5 report 
	- one sentence for each item in excel
	- add pic in slides
	- copy the useful part in jupyterlab and make one all-in version

3. Check the Jipipe PyImageJ work and see what kind of working examples we need


4. Check the new project of VPL, and its documentations

My thoughts:

- AI voice membership lasts one month, we could still add new feature to it.

【Reasearch Field Study】
- I did some research of searching keywords: imageJ, visual programming and find:
	- ImageJ is highly releated with  Material Science and Medical Image Processing

	- Visual Programming papers include 3D/large-scale image features


- Most of the papers are published in mdpi, nature scientific report, nature method
