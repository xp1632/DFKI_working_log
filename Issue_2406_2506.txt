Issues 2406_2506:
-----------------------------------------

1. Should we add CodeGenerator code into the paper?

- what information does it provide? 
- is it too long?
- how to refer it?

- it's too hard to explain the code in Chaldene clearly here, we'll state
in text instead of using code



2. I/O step

- we first state what we want to do in this process, then we state the challenges and we solve it one by one. 

- why do we need input handle and input parameter in the code snippet at the same time?

- the second time we get paramters from ImageJ ops is to do Op matching


2.1 Op Matching

- should we include the Op matching java code from ImageJ 
- we should provide the most core code of stating type match 
- then describe a lot in text

2.2 Java type mapping

- we want to find the reference of Chaldene provided datatypes for handle
- but I forget where it is 
- we could check the issue of how we state the mapping table
- it's really really hard to find reference for supported datatypes in Chadlene

- I'll keep searching for 10 mins then just write down what I saw
- here: types/Datatypes  ; not in Handle Types https://github.com/c3di/Visual-Programming-Language/blob/main/src/editor/types/DataType.ts
