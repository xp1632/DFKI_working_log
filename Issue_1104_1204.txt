Issues 1104_1204:
-----------------------------------------
(v)1. format_required parameters

 - modification in node spec class to deal with format_required_parameters
 !(tuple problem later )- deal with (x,y) tuple parameter 
 - slight refactory to put CodeSnippetGen into NodeSpecGen
	- now we only take `op_name` ,`mapping_table`
 
(v)2. Modification on CodeSnippetGen class to get multi code snippets
	- get_op_info() method


3. Modification on NodeSpecGen class to get multi json 

	- in following cell, we have three jsons
	- but it 
	(!)- op Matching no longer needed
	   - even for single operation, O

(v)4. Refactor the codeSnippetGenerator and the paramterHandler into 
Node spec class to be a part of its pipeline method 


5. Teams meeting

Hi Tim, hi Fei, here's a short 【summary for today's thesis feedback】: 

- start writing thesis next week 
- overlapping with the final coding work in case we need to refresh our mind


here's a short 【summary for other feedback】: 

- Paper Writing:

	- How to write `contribution` part in paper?
		- first find related works who want to solve the same/similar problems
		- illustrate the differences between our work and theirs
		- emphasize our features and take a space in this area with our method

- Clean Coding Rules, refering <Clean Code> by Robert C. Martin

	1. Good Code is like a good book, which is easy and clear to read
	
	2. Only keep comments when it's necessary. By necessary, one case is unavoid magic code that needs detailed records; one case is the long comments that tells the functionality of a high level module as documentation.
	
	3. In other cases, use self-explain method name `read_image()` instead of `# read image` comments
	
	4. One function should only take one step depth in structure hierarchy just like a book should have Chapter 1 -> chapter 1.2
	
	5. Use unit test to decrease debugging time



-------------------------------------------
Main task today:

v 1. Get input parameter,output parameter
2. Multi operation problem

3. Summary on team meeting



----------------------------------------------
My thoughts:

1. somepace in NodeSpec, we need to go through the OpInfo again
	- and add its title to the json's different node items' name

2. - Two problems left:

- how to deal with Multi-operation under one op name
- `Tuple` related processing code adding in `Format module in JSON generation`
