Issues 2011_2111:
-----------------------------------------
1. How do we know if a plugin of Fiji rely on its own interface or not

	- before I manually checked if a plugin could be used by:
	
		- import it via local jar and %classpath 
		- check error message
		
		- decompose a jar file online by :
		http://www.javadecompilers.com/result?currentfile=fiji/threshold/Auto_Threshold.java
		
		- check the class in the decomposed java file
		
		- check javadoc of this specific plugin
		- figure out if it's imagej1 or Image2 by its import prefix
		- no idea of finding if it has Fiji-UI-depedency
	
	
1.1 How to figure out ImageJ1 vs ImageJ2?

- they have different groupId: 
- https://imagej.net/develop/architecture#maven-component-structure

- the ImageJ2 has the groupId of net.imagej
- which means the gateway we use in jupyter is ImageJ2 
- why can't the fiji gateway work!!!!!!!!


1.2 How to figure out UI-depedency?

- we know for sure ImageJ2 is UI-independent
	
	

2. Check JIPipe documentation
 https://jipipe.hki-jena.de/documentation/advanced-node-info/

- they have custom plugins via SciJava plugin interface







-------------------------------------------
Main task today:

1. to use External Plugins of Fiji on Jupyter lab via gateway or locally






----------------------------------------------
My thoughts:

- We're using Jupyterlab version 3.6 
- jupyter lab has new release of Version 4
- I didn't update it because of the Ganymede, Ijava kernel
- I am not sure if Beakerx has Version 4 support of jupyterlab
----

- Even with new Op not new plugin
- we also need to tell the user if the operation inside the Op is suitable for
net.imageJ
