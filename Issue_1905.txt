Issues 1905:
-----------------------------------------
1. The original icons are not satisfying, we choose another color icon from MUI
and the possible pin icon may need to be found in other website

2. We start from the color picker buttuon beacause we already have component in Reactflow
	check the color chooser here:
	https://reactflow.dev/docs/guides/state-management/
	and 
	https://reactflow.dev/docs/examples/nodes/custom-node/
	check the update node here: https://reactflow.dev/docs/examples/nodes/update-node/
	
	-They use another state management library zustand, should I also use it?
	-Or we only use part of it
		-where does the Color palette panel come from?

2.1 Check useNodeState hook: 
https://reactflow.dev/docs/api/hooks/use-nodes-state/

The example is too complicated, the only thing we need to use is <input type:'color'/>

However they recommend Zustand as state management library

2.2 We need to figure out how to keep the button for show and the functional inoput color
in the same place
	-We can not give a icon to input element because it doesn't accept children
	-We can put them in a <div> and set different z value for them
	-Ugly, maybe just remove the button

2.3 Where to set the color, at first we set the color to the parent node 

3. Remember to test resize after the color set problem is solved
	We need to minus the height of new button bar we add
	
	
4.With Pinned function, we might need a good encapusulation for it because we may use this 
wiget elewhere

	-And a button click visual effect is needed 
	-className="nodrag" could easily forbid the user from dragging







-------------------------------------------
Main task today:
1.- Add Color picker function button:  
		-how to update a node's color https://reactflow.dev/docs/guides/state-management/
		
	detailed implementation:
	1. We click the button on a specific node 
		//Now we click the button, the bgColor changes from white to black
		
	2. A color palette panel pop up
		// we only need to figure out where's panel comes from and should it be a input
		it comes from <input type="color">
	3. user choose a color 
		//we pass the color value to background color
	4. Cureent node's background color is updated
	
	
2. - Add pin/unpin function button, this body enable dragable or not for node
	1. first find out how to show svg in button
	2. It shows behind the lock Icon
	3. Too annoying, maybe do the dragable first
	
3. React svg icon
