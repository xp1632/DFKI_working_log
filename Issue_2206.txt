1.flex property for items: https://www.zhangxinxu.com/wordpress/2019/12/css-flex-deep/

flex has flex-basis,flex-grow,flex-shrink

-flex-basis is the fixed unit of space
-flex-grow is how to distribute spare space
-flex-shrink is how to distribute space when space is not enough

-Let's check the rule of flex:

flex: none | auto | [ <'flex-grow'> <'flex-shrink'>? || <'flex-basis'> ]

- | : means the property around this symbol is Exclusive(排他)，
	 can not appear at the same time with other properties
	 
- []: means rule range

Thus all the followings are correct:

flex: auto;
flex: none;
/* 3个值 */
flex: 1 1 100px;

- let's check the symbols inside []:

- ? : ? around flex-shrink means, flex-shrink is not obligatory
	we can have value of flex-shrink, or we can omit it
	such as flex: flex-grow: 1 flex-basis: 100px

- || : means OR, which means we could use the conditions around ||
	are both correct. flex-grow+flex-shrink   OR flex-basis 

For example:

flex: auto;
flex: none;
/* 1个值，flex-grow */
flex: 1;
/* 1个值，flex-basis */
flex: 100px;
/* 2个值，flex-grow和flex-basis */
flex: 1 100px;
/* 2个值，flex-grow和flex-shrink */
flex: 1 1;
/* 3个值 */
flex: 1 1 100px;

2. Setting values for flex item
----------------------------------------
-Initial values:
	flex:initial equals flex: 0 1 auto.
	here flex-growth is 0, flex-shrink is 1, flex-basis is auto
	
	which means,  
	0:- the item would not enlarge itself to occupy spare space
	1:- the item would decrease itself to fit in the small space
	auto: the size would automatically adjust based on itself and container
	
-So if we [only] set display: flex in container:
	the items would not occupy the spare space when the items are small
	than contaniner;
	the items would shrink itself to fit in the small container
-----------------------------------------
-Auto values:
	flex:auto  equals flex: 1 1 auto
	
-So if we also add flex:auto in items:

.container {
    display: flex;
}
.container item {
    flex: auto;
}

	the items would occupy the spare space when the container is too large
	and shrink to fit in the container when the container is small

--------------------------------------------
-None values:
	flex:none equals flex: 0 0 auto
	
	the items would not enlarge or shrink when the container size
	doesn't fit
	In this case, when the container's size is smaller than items
	the items would exceed and overflow to the outside of container
