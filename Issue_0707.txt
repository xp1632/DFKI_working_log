0. When solving the maxwidth Issue of Stickynote:

I was bothered by the resize time loop exceed problem.
So I try to solve it

- This problem is out of my range, so I wrote down as far as I reach and go back to 

1. MinHeight and minWidth problem of Stickynote
	-After setting the min Width and height for Stickynote
	-The inner color layer is fixed, however, the outer node is not
	
	-where to set the minSize of it?
	-in nodebody?
	-I need to check the code deeper
	
	-The container has a common class .vp-node-container
	-And only width is definedd as 100% here
	
	-We can not set minHeight here as well, since all nodes use this class
	
	-So the main problem is caused by the Resize Component,
	-after changing the minHeight in Resize Component, it works
	
1.1 After resizing, the color is floated to the right as 1 pixel

	-Could be several reasons
	-one is calculation error after resizing
	
	-another one is in somewhere, there's a border
	
	-it's from the box shadow we defined in .react-flow_node.selected in VPEditor.css
	
	- The main cause is that, the stickyNote_node__body div is larger than vp-node-container div
		-They have 4px difference, why? 
		-the control line of the resize?
		
		-It's because, the resize component should be most outside of the element,
		-however, in our case, it's inside two other divs

Main task today:

1. Careful fix of css issues in VP project

2. Publish it to VP4 to see the actual effect

3. Continue the last part of useGraph code reading
