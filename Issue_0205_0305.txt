Issues 0205_0305:
-----------------------------------------
1. Although a little irritated by messy organizations

- I'll finish my part of work this week
- which is finish








-------------------------------------------
Main task today:

(v)1. Daily applications 

(v)2. Slides assembling into picture series for thesis

3. Skeleton Outline of Method then Background

4. Add __init__ and test Package import 

(v)5. Group meeting summary

----------------------------------------------
My thoughts:

1. Should I put the video link in the supplementary materials of thesis?
	- I prefer not, because we'll send the thesis in papar format
	- It's better if we have several screenshots to show the content in the video
	- We don't need to squeeze the figures into one large one 
		- just show it in seperate ones to take the pages :)


2. We don't need a seperate motivation chapter
- motivation should be stated in `Introduction`
- and re-address in end of `Background`

- Hi Tim, hi Fei, here's a short summary of today's team meeting:

【1. Comic Book method for writing paper】
	- we can use a series of figures to sort out our minding before writing down the manuscript
	- we tell the story of the paper only by the figures and its captions
	- normally the figures in comic book should be finished at [publish-ready] level

【2. How to find the limitation of ChatGPT/or other fancy stuffs】
	- one failing case would be enough
	- we can knock it down by claiming its unreliability

【3. Generalized or Specific algorithm】
	- `Is your method generalized for other xxx` 
	- This is mostly the first question when presenting your work in image processing
	- We make the decision of going more generalized or more specific only by our intention at the beginning, nothing good or bad
