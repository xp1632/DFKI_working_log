Issues 1309_1409:
-----------------------------------------
1. Selling points of the paper

	- experimental groups with limited programming experience 
		- still rely heavily on manual image processing
	
	- [reproducibility]
	- [lower the barrier]
	- auto- conversion between the image representations for non programmer
		- “image” can be mapped to concreate data layouts in various ways,
		- for example as numpy.ndarray [28], torch.tensor [29], 
		- or raw pointer, 
		- each with variations in color channel, channel order, location of memory, and pixel intensity.
	
	- how a visual programming editor (VPE) can be used by non-programmers for reproducible scientific image processing tasks,
	- how several real-world use cases can be solved using the system.
	- 
	- until Chapter 3

	- AI voice, clara : https://genny.lovo.ai/project/650179521fc3dc00235d11ac
	
	- Intro video, script: https://chat.openai.com/c/9fbf153f-f83b-45be-9116-e6af7de25044

2. The large sections are divided.

- now we put the node pieces into belonging section

- we filter the menu until Kornia, then we filter the three list of lib

	- kornia_adjustment : tooltip: hue/contrast/sharpness

3.  Check for reference

	- 1.
	[1] journal: doi should be full: https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.01-12-0593
	[2] journal: doi missing, wrong format
	[3] journal: 
	




-------------------------------------------
Main task today:

1. APPENDIX of node list

1.5 Read paper and find saling point

2. Script of Video


3. Rough Version of a Script

---

4. For video, we put aside the the usecase and would use the showcase instead

5. check the submission requirements of video and paper
