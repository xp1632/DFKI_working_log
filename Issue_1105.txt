Issues 1105:
-----------------------------------------
1. Locate NodeExtension's code in the project
	-Search 'this is a package including...' and find src-->NodeTypeExtension
	-The text is in __init__.json respectively
	
	-Search for 'MuiAccordionDetails' ,
		Find the file NodeLibraryList.tsx

2. We start modifying from MUI's Accordion Component 
	-Check Accordion in https://mui.com/material-ui/react-accordion/
	
3. Aria label is semantic tags for Accessibility of disabled people https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/accessibility.html

4. Check the theme in MUI, because we've met it twice in project
	https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/theming/#themeprovider
	https://mui.com/material-ui/experimental-api/css-theme-variables/usage/
	
	ThemeProvider should be the parent of the components you are trying to customize
		-didn't look too deeper, just for understanding the usage
		
	-theme.palette defines the color theme https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/palette/
	-theme.typography defines the font family and font size https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/typography/
	-theme.spacing defines the space unit, default 1 spacing = 8 pixel https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/spacing/
	-theme.breakpoints defines different screen size(xs,sm,md,lg,xl) for responsive design https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/breakpoints/

Main task today:

1.Edge Menu,Handle Menu's Padding
	-changed to <MenuList> 's padding to 4px in the top and bottom as in NodeMenu

2.NodeExtension  
	-Mock the style of jupyter extension side bar
	-pay attention to if the content looks the same when in the page and when in sidebar
		The Divider Component's width should be '100%'
		The MenuItem's width is flexiable and the content in it is auto
		We don't have a ICON for package, do we need one?
	
	-The color of the menuitem title is not correct
	-The color of the menuitem discription is not correct
	-The color of divider line is not correct
	
	-The icon/font of 'Installed' is not the same

My thoughts:

1. I would like to know how to evoke different context menu base on cursor location
2. I would like to start the UI layout design course in coursera

1. In github, when we commit we can refer the issue we solve in commit msg:
