Issues 1005_1305_1405:
-----------------------------------------
1. We start by writing Initial Attempts

- For each chapter,we have a rough paragraph outline
- We take the other people's paper as reference

2.Introductory paragraph at the beginning of each chapter

- should be concise and serve as a high-level roadmap
- guide the reader to the chapter where they could find more details


2.1 we could write the method layer by layer

(v)- Chapter 4 Method intro paragraph
(v)- Chapter 4.1 Initial Integration Attempets intro paragraph
		- here we tell the Chaldene mechanism 
			- focus on how visual node `works` in backend
			- the functionnatlities part is not our main focus
			- we'll mention it in the background Chaldene
			
		- and how we divide the RQ 1 into sub questions
(v)- Chapter 4.1.1 Running Java-based ImageJ in Jupyterlab 
		- here we talk about the ImageJ gateway
		
		---
		- (v) we decide to put the kernels in one chapter instead of listing out, there's nothing to say about the kernels
		- then different kernels 
			- for each kernel , we make one sentence of intro
			- one sentence of pros and one sentence of cons

(v)3. We figure out how to insert code snippet properly in MSword:

https://github.com/xp1632/DFKI_working_log/issues/53





-------------------------------------------
Main task today:

(v)1. Limitation Section in Discussion
(v)2. Conclusion 
(v)4. Figure: Auto generation part- single node 1st organize

	- we need images for auto `bacth` generation
	- should we do it now? 
	- My advice is to forget about the publish-ready shit
		- just make a really quick image and put it there
		- if it's really messy and we cannot stand it
		- we'll edit it later, always polish works after it's roughly done
	
()5. Figure: Auto generation part- batch 
	- we need some new figures here so we'll do it later
	- the new figures are still built on top of old ones

(v)6. Writing Method 4, 4.1, 4.1.1 






----------------------------------------------
My thoughts:

- My only requirement for my thesis:
is to tell the story clearly.
- We just need to write down what we did and how we did it

---

- The website reference is a little annoying
- let's just keep it as (website http:xxxxx) and do it later :)

---

- Should we talk about Java mechanism?
	- I don't think it's relevant
	- All Java kernel for jupyter is based on JShell otherwise it won't work
	- But we need to state we've considered this constraint




--------------------------------------------
Take away:

1. Slight work in code side:
- Add __init__.json 

2. I got the first non-rejection follow-up information from Heidelberg

	- keep doing it!
	- also this means the original cv needs modification

3. How to write reference for website using fucking mendeley when its
chrome extension doesn't work

- Add it manually to your library via:
- https://www.mendeley.com/reference-manager/library/all-references

3.2 Or we could search this website in 

MsWord---> References -->Search ---> input the website link
----> find the website ---> at the upper right of the website item -->
 click + Cite
 
4. When refer to a paper, we need to rephrase it or summarize it in our own words instead of using the same sentence
