Issues 2606_2706:
-----------------------------------------
1. We check our documentation about pipeline enchancement:
https://github.com/xp1632/VPE_IP/issues/80

- The first several paragraphs of 4.3.2 should be, why we want to modify the single pipeline, how we want to modify it, and what we want to get 

https://github.com/xp1632/VPE_IP/issues/78#issuecomment-2027343270
- here we can surely talk about behavior-driven development

- here we also need to finalize the main challenges we want to solve in 


2. Detailed challenges of generating code snippet 
	- class and subclass issue caused by inaccurte API OpInfo
	     - more detailed mapping table 
		 - 
	






-------------------------------------------
Main task today:
1. We start writing 4.3.2 Batch generation

2. We'll do one or two applications this afternoon

3. If we finish the content earlier, I recommend we take one hour to finish up the reference, in case we don't want to do it in the future.

- or not, if you are sick of it 
- tomorrow i'll still be here, or not hhhhhhha



----------------------------------------------
My thoughts:

1. Should we mention change of code structureï¼Ÿ

- I kind of don't know how to state it clearly 
- maybe we could slightly mention it?  





--------------------------------------------
Take away:

- Limitation: IJ1 
- Future : Pipeline Feasibility for Python Libraries
