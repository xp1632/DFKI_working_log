Issues 1306:
-----------------------------------------
1. Delete round corner for accordion

2. Filebond hint label font size,family

3. Comment node's placeholder's font color
	-Where to set the font color for comment node
		-For comment node, the placeholder is put inside the .node__header
		-We'll put the defination of comment node's header in commment node.css
		-however it's still not working

	-when we put style in input, the color is working
	-The reason is that we didn't define color: inherit in <InplaceInput/> component

4. The input in node panel is in widget, we can define the font of them there

	-I'll add an index.css file for widgets component to define css variables
	-I also add a common inputStyles in Widgets.tsx to use the css variables

	
5. Icon
	-Treeview three icon
		-We first start with treeview icon
			-Check SearchedTreeView.tsx
				-we've set --vp-treeview-icon-size for <ExpandMore/>
				it works ,where's the rest three icons?
			-The rest three icons are defined in SearchMenu.tsx
		-SearchedTreeView is an element component in SearchMenu
		-I set the MuiSvgIcon-root to icon-size, however
		It didn't enlarge the parent node, part of the icon is covered
		-What's the difference with the expand icon?
		
		-We find the reason in the parent element of it,
		the width of the parent element is set as 15px,
		after setting it as auto, the icon looks good and is not covered
				
	-Sticky node
	
	
	-Minimap

6. Node handle/Link

7. Add comments for usage of font 
	-if you are worried the old version has something missing
		-just search the keyword again






-------------------------------------------
Main task today:
1. Fixing remaining issues in Theming
  Used by:
	-add comments for usage of font 1234.etc
	-
2. A summary for Paper

3. Read the project code from top index.tsx
	-get the relation of different component
	-Better have a graph 





----------------------------------------------
My thoughts:

1. Does the input widgets in node panel need label for it?
	- If so, this is an example of adding label:
	--------------------
	export function TextInput(props: WidgetProps): JSX.Element {
	  const { value, className, onChange, label } = props;
	  const id = label?.toLowerCase().replace(' ', '-');
	  return (
		<label htmlFor={id}>
		  {label}
		  <input
			id={id}
			className={className}
			type={'text'}
			defaultValue={value}
			style={inputStyles}
			onChange={(e) => {
			  onChange(e.target.value);
			}}
		  />
		</label>
	  );
	}
	-------------------






--------------------------------------------
Take away:

1. When you define a property in parent element,
however the child element didn't inherit that property

-The reason is that, we didn't define for example:
color: inherit in children element
