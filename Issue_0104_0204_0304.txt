Issues 0104_0204_0304:
-----------------------------------------
1. We'll first do step 0: wrap-up pipeline parts without adding new features:

- requirements of current pipeline
- in code snippet, calling op, when a parameter is not required, please place `None` to take the place

2. We'll continue to next step: 1 

- we start with adding another node:
- for example: threshold.otsu
- and during that, we fix why it doesn't work for threshold.otsu

- we'll test threshold.otsu tomorrow morning, as long as op matching works
- it works
 





-------------------------------------------
Main task today:

1. (v)Pipeline refactor in : https://github.com/Max-ChenFei/VPE_IP/issues/84

2. Step 1 for pipeline




(v)4. Follow-up on thesis stuffs
	- (v) follow-up email to sabine 
	- (v)after getting grade, print registration form and grade certificate, go to examination office
		- if she's there, give the documents and talk about ungrade extra credits, second examiner
		(v)- if not there, leave the documents with a email 
	- (v)the booking system for examination office is not working while the study coordinator booking is working
	
	


----------------------------------------------
My thoughts:

1. Registration of thesis and ungrade extra credits

	- I'll contact lorang again tomorrow morning

	- if Possible, I'll request for ungraded the extra credits I get
	- by credits regulation https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/study/programmes/master/media-informatics.html
	- And only keep these courses as graded
