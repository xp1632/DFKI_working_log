Issues 3107_0108:
-----------------------------------------
1. Add 'any' datatype to filter

	1.1 We noticed that, since we only filtered the node from config
	and no Command TreeView data is filtered
	
	-because the command treeview data normally has no handles
	-except reroute 
	
	-moving the filter to Search Menu may solve this problem

2. Move the filtering one level up, from SearchTreeView to SearchMenu

-do the filtering in the nofigtoTreeData Part

2.1 How to deal with ToExpand?
	-we can keep the TOFilter Flag, when this flag, expand
	
2.2 And we do not need to send the startHandleInfo to SearchTreeView anymore,
To SearchMenu is enough

2.3 For ToExpand, we could leave the toFilter in child level to control the ToExpand

2.4 We need to pass the filteredTreedata to child 

-Currently, 
-we have original treedata from both config and commands

-and we filter the treedata with datatype, and passed the filteredData To child

We want:

- we first filter data from only config

-we have the filterDataV1 

- we add the commandsToTreeData to filterDataV1 and get filterDataV2

-we pass filterDataV2 to child


- Now we debug and check how the menu is mounted

2.5 We find out, it's a little hard to addCommand after filtering 
, when we set the [] for useEffect as commands, we'll have multiple commandsmenu
because commands is go through multiple times. When we put it as filteredTreedata, also wrong
,because the filteredTreedata is constantly changing, we can not render the menu all the time.

- So for now, I only keep the [] as empty,
- then the commandsmenu would only be add the filterData once when it's mounted




---------------------------

3. CreateVariable , createFunction node's name need to be unique

-In our project, we have utils/uniquePools.ts


-in useScene.ts we also return varsNamePool and funNamePool
	const varsNamePool = useRef<IUniqueNamePool>(new UniqueNamePool());
	const funNamePool = useRef<IUniqueNamePool>(new UniqueNamePool());
	-which are instances fo UniqueNamePool()


-Let's check CreateVariable and CreateFunction()

3.1 what' the name in this issue?

-is it some id, or title, or name property in some data
-So let's create a Function and see its data

- By adding breakpoint in CreateFunction.tsx

- we noticed that we return a <div>
and the div's title is title={`add a new function named ${title}`}

-and inside the <div>, we have <div> node__header

-and inside node_header we have <InplaceInput> with text ={title}

-and <div> node__header has siblings node__body

3.1.1  Find title in CreateFunction
- For CreateFunction, we have id as nodeId when create it for the first time
- and we get title from the data 
- we get data passed to CreateFunction as type ConnectableData


-here title is set as newFdun_0 all the time because that's what we get from 'data'

- we also have a function updateName to update the title when we edit it in inPlaceText

3.1.2 is there certain logic of Functions name? should it be newFdun_num ?

-Let's check the namePool and see how it works


3.1.4 When creating the function node multiple times ,we already have newFdun_num logic

- how did it happen?





3.2 In useGraph.ts, we have useEffect() about createFunction and toBeUpdated


3.3 In useScene,ts, we have extra rules when onNodeAdd and onNodeDelete


3.4 that's it? I expected also a openWidget in VPEditor


3.5 What's the usage of CreateFunction and CreateVariable?
- from the definition of CreateFunction, there's no functions for it



	
	









-------------------------------------------
Main task today:
1. Last steps of Search Context menu:
	1.1 add any datatype in filter condition
	1.2 move the filtering from SearchTreeView to SearchMenu
	1.4 move getHandleDataType to utils
