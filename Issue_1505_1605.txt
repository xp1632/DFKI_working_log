-------------------------------------------
Main task today:

(v)1. Write 4.1.2 Handling Multi-languages Jupyter Kernels
	- we should first write after we find a working multi-languages kernel
	beakerx, we try to somehow let the imageJ works 
	
	
	
(v)2. Write 4.1.3 Reevaluation and change of Approach
	- after investigating multi-kernenl doesn't work, we find to achieve the original 
	- we face two options
		1. develop a whole java code deserilization for Chaldene
			and use ImageJ in an isolated Java Environment
			- but this is just porting ImageJ functionanality from its 
			software to another platform with additional efforts but not quite much usage
		2. Find a new way out, how can we integrate while keeping compatibility with Chaldene as premise
		- Propose our revised question, maybe with  `Python kernel` 

3. Write 4.2.1 PyImageJ wrapper
	- here we slightly talk about jgo etc of wrapping java code into python
	- then we talk about the framework of pyimagej
	- how it wrapped java execution inside of python kernel via jgo
	
	





----------------------------------------------
My thoughts:

1. Figure: Auto generation part- batch 
	- we need some new figures here so we'll do it later
	- the new figures are still built on top of old ones

2. We can try KL position again by https://vollmer.kl.dfki.de/



--------------------------------------------
Take away:

- I am not sure if lacking a complete master certificate would influence my job application
- we need to think about this decision carefully
- Initial plan is to keep current pace and try to find a job
- If we really can not find a job at July, we'll considering
handing in the thesis and get a 4.0 certificate, and change the residence 
permit into job visa
