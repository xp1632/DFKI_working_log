-1. the distribution of test and training data does not differ

`However, in all these settings, it is crucial that the underlying distribution does not differ between training and testing, be it by interventions or other changes. `

- 2.Causal reasoning:
denotes the process of drawing conclusions from a causal model, similar to the way probability theory allows us to reason about the outcomes of random experiments.

- 3. causal reasoning allows us to analyzethe effect of interventions or distribution changes.

- 4. even full knowledge of P does not make the solution trivial, and
we need additional assumptions

- 5. A well-known topos holds that `correlation does not imply causation`;
  statistical properties alone do not determine causal structures.
  
- 6. The random variables only **appear** tobe dependent.
  - The random variables we observe are conditioned on others (often implicitly by a selection bias)
  
- 7. **observational distribution**, where the word “observational” refers to the fact that we are passively observing the system without intervening. 

	- **intervention distributions** ： we interven on X or Y and see if the oberservation changes to see the causation direction
	
- 8. First, Figure 1.3 nicely illustrates Reichenbach’s common cause principle. The dependence between X and Y admits several causal explanations, and X and Y become independent if we condition on Z in the right-hand figure: The image and the label share no information that is not contained in the intention.
