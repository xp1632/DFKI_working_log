Issues 1707:
-----------------------------------------

1. In Search menu, add Node by 'Enter'

	-I don't quite understand about
	'next menu', if we are creating node, why menu?

	-what's the first item of the getter of setter'?


1.1 Where to add KeyDown event for search menu item?
	-Try where we add arrowdown event for it
	-By searching Arrow, we find in SearchedTreeView.tsx
		-<ControlledTreeview/> we defined onArrowUpKeyDown
		-We defined it in the same place


1.2 How should I add KeyDown event?
	-We define it in <ControlledTreeview/> and trigger it in its return
	<Treeview> onKeyDown , if (e.key ==='Enter')
	-The function of onEnterKeyDown is defined inside <SearchedTreeview/>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

1.2.1 After reading the code, I think the Enter event should be located in
a higher level, in the SearchedTreeView just like the item click event,
instead of inside its children ControlledTreeview

-in ControlledTreeView()'s renderTreeItem(), 
item: TreeItemData, item has, item.onItemClick

<SearchMenu/> defined on ItemClick and we pass it through,
---> <SearchedTreeView>
---> <ControlledTreeView />
---> <StyledTreeItem>




1.4 How to create respective node while certain item is presse Enter?

	-we could check the click event we set for the menu
		
		in <StyledTreeItem/> we find the onClick we defined here,
		it has something to do with 'item'
	
	-The click event is defined in MuiTreeItem
	-addNode

	1.4.1 How do we know which node are we focusing?
		-parent item without expand
		-child item with expand?


	1.4.2 How to create node?
		
		-some node create is in useScene.ts
			-addNode() onNodeAdd()
		-we search addNode, and find sticky node create in useKeyDown.ts hook
		-sceneAction?.addNode('stickyNote') is how we create StickyNote node

		!-in SearchMenu.tsx, we have addNode for our menu
		

	1.4.3 How to create certain node we want?
		
		-we create the node by learning how the onItemClick did

		-in ControlledTreeView()'s renderTreeItem(), 
		item: TreeItemData, item has, item.onItemClick

		<SearchMenu/> defined on ItemClick and we pass it through,
		---> <SearchedTreeView>      onEnterKeyDown ={createNodeOnEnterKeyDown} 
									in this layer we create the node based on item:TreeItemData
		
---> <ControlledTreeView />   get event and trigger the SearchedTreeView
										's onEnterKeyDown()

									
											
		---> <TreeView>

		--> <StyledTreeItem> it's only an item with style
	
	1.4.4 What's the props for onEnterKeyDown()?
		(e,items) or (items)
		
		-for onArrowKeyDown, they are under onKeyDown of <TreeView>,
			so they are ()=> void
		-however, their cycle ended at SearchenTreeView
		-while our enter function should be passed to upper layer
			SearchMenu.tsx to addNode
		
		-where should we catch the keyboard event?

		
	1.5 The current problem is: the onEnterKeyDown() is not broadcast
	from <TreeView> to upper components from onKeyDown,
	
	we need to define something here

	We have a defined TreeItemData.onClick

	1.6 What's the difference between onItemClick and onClick?
	

	1.7 we don't have item in TreeView but we have item in StyledtreeView

	-what should I do 55555555555555555555555555555555


2. I am confused by the structure of Search Menu, why does it has so many 
layers???????

	-somehow, the route is clear, when we press key enter in Treeview Item, the onEnterKeyDown
	we defined in SearchMenu is triggered

	-now we have two remaining questionsï¼š
	
	1. get correct nodeItem in SearchedTreeView

	2. create correct node in SearchMenu


2.1 Defining onKeyDown event in StyledTreeItem is not useful
	
	-We go from <TreeView> in <ControlledTreeview> and directly go to SearchMenu

	-What we get from focus node is 'Variable',which is a string
	
	-however, what we need is a treedata, then we can use it configtype and build it in SearchMenu
	
	-Or do we really need treedata, can we 

2.2 Item click, they didn't use <TreeView> ,used <StyledTreeItem instead>
	we can not put the event in styledTreeItem as click do,
	we need to put it inside TreeView

2.3 setFocusedNode returns string
	however, we need TreeItem data, so that we could see if it has children array,
	and determine not to render it because it's a parent node

	How should we solve this?

Main task today:

1. Search menu new features in github

2. Continue the code reading in Line 446 in VP project useGraph

3. Part 1 's lebenstest question





----------------------------------------------
My thoughts:







--------------------------------------------
Take away:

1. delete non-used remote branch which still exists in local

git branch -d Feat/sticky-note
git prune
