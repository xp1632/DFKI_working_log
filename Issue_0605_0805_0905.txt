Issues 0605_0805_0905:
-----------------------------------------
(v)1. Checked [Technical report], we found we are more similiar to this 
	- because we'll also write technical details
	- problems we met and how to improve it during our process in the thesis

2. We check the figure slides for one time


3. Write paragraph outline for method section
	()- copy slides figures 
	()- copy slides notes


(v)4. I am so sick of making citations for non-paper right now,
let's just highlight it and deal with it later


(v)5. If it's hard to decide the location of some content component

- just leave it with a red { ...} and a mark
- we can always put it in a better place

(v)6.1 We figure out why package import doesn't work
- lacking `__init__.json`

----------------------------------------------
My thoughts:

- I feel the differences between Presentation and Paper
	- In pre we try to tell the story in a way that raises audience's interest and curiosuty
	- In paper, we cut these shit and use all logic, everyone knows where's the answer is 
	

- Thus we only propose our question at the beginning
	- call back during the chapter when we want to give the answer


- I realized that I can not have `publish-ready figures` in advance
as a shallow and innocent master student
	- let's just get it through with a `figure` :) 


- The main shortcoming of my final thesis paper could be `you have too many figures that are not for a paper`, but whatever, I can still argue I need this flowchart for the readers' better understanding

- The main reason I do so, is that, it's so painful to write a long paper, how did I manage that during my bachelor? 
	- I remembered that I found a relevant book for my bachelor topic, and write my story based on the book chapter structures
	- The structure is always hard
	- It is different for current situation, because I have a ready presenetation
	- The suffering part is transferring what we want to express in a presentation to text-based paper
	-But don't panic, you can do it (with the help of xxxxt and xxxxxy)

**Figures draft online**: https://1drv.ms/p/s!Ai6__2xAomSdrpNKNgjhYYpJQlL8bQ?e=UUw4d0
**Manuscript draft online**: https://1drv.ms/w/s!Ai6__2xAomSdro8mxTR3ZeRa6wIicQ?e=ClMxWc

3. Stick to what you've got in the slides and just assembling the content
- we can always improvise later when our creatity is needed then

- image yourself as a stevedore, just move the goods in required section
- put the goods in a tidy manner and just leave it as it is
