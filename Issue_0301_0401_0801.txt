Issues 0301_0401_0801:
-----------------------------------------
1. we start by importing imageJ by classpath

- We can't decide whether to create a node only for `ImageJ initialization`
- However, after checking the other VP extensions such as `scikitImage`
- We noticed that each node `import` everytime 

---
Thus, we'll first try the `Initialization inside every node` schema

---

2. We ask Fei, author of this VP project, we might have some misunderstanding
of mechanism of VP nodes

- we'll check the `generators` codes in VP project and see what we could do

---

### `generators/visual_program.ts`

- We start with understanding `visual_program` in VP
    - because it's used in `code_generator.ts` file
---

- **Definition**: 
	- A `Visual program` is made up of several functions
	- Each function is directional acyclic graph of nodes and edges
	- Functions start with `Flow Control.main` node or `new function` node

---
- **FunctionCallsFunc**

	- We search for `FunctionCalls` Functions by `configType` of `function call`

---

### ``
-------------------------------------------
Main task today:
0. import imageJ gateway 
	- ImageJ1 can only be created once
	- how does this node thing work?
	- we import the same thing for each node every time?
	

1. Make one workflow or one node of ImageJ
	- read image
	- Gaussian
	- output result

2.
