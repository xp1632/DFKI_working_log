**Seminar Structure Feedbacks:**
--- 

### Meeting Feedbacks:

1. 【quick summary】 for Op Auto generation showcase
	- design a fixed procedure and show it live 
	- let the live video be backup plan

2. 【quick summary】 for Seminar Slides:

- 1.[Backgraound] : one sentence mentions hiwi work, 
   more backgrounds for imageJ/Chaldene
   
- 2. [Motivation] : 
   - a. Known parts of why we need Chaldene as Visual Programming System
   - b. Why ImageJ is important
   - c. Our ImageJ in Chaldene expand the boundary of ImageJ

- 3. [Methodology]:
	- a. Add more technical details in Method 2 PyImageJ
	- b. Add [Automatic ImageJ Op Node Generation] to Part 3

- 4. [Progress Made]
	- one showcase video of segmentation
	- one live operation of generating ImageJ Op Node

- 5. [Next Step]
    - we'll keep the Knowledge Graph for ImageJ image types

- 6. [Conclusion]
	- Give a narrow conclusion
	- 'With this method', we show how ImageJ could be intergrated in Chaldene project
	- And we prove the expansibility of Chaldene for other libraries

3. Other hints for presentation:
	- grab an opportunity to show the detailed issues and organized way of working
	- If questions emerge during presentation, ask the audience if she/he wants to discuss now for 4 mins
	    - or discuss in the end('I am happy to discuss etc'), to keep the 20mins punctuality
	- 20mins , 16slides

### Fei's feedback:

- From large to detail,provide background for method
-  gradually fade in and fade out

- From theory --> code  , prepare the code if they want 

[Summary:]  At first show people what we want to do
- then show how we do it in a simple link graph

0. First we roughly make a structure for slides based on github 

- though we have many feedbacks and information from different source
- we start with our own bone 


---

### 1. [Title]:

- Which template should we use?
	- dfki.ai
	- Uds 
[v]	- combination? 

- Whose name on the title
[v]	- me
	- me and 3 supervisors if they asked me to add the name
	- Or add it in the defense

2. We've set the template for slides and title,QA page


3. [Backgraound]
- We try to create a commic that tells the experimentists difficulty
	- but the image MS designer creaetd is not as good as we want
	- we could manual edit the picture
	- Or we could try our luck in other people's paper

- Three things we want to the user to know about the background
- I want to add some images or Icon that makes the background part less boring

- I found some useful templates from 
https://www.presentationgo.com/presentation/abstract-fluid-bubbles-powerpoint-google-slides/


-------------------------------------------
Main task today:

(v) 1. where and how should I update the auto generation pipeline?
	- I just committed the two parts to VPL project, my branch of ImageJ
(v) 2. Info for Seminar and Defense requirements

(v) 3. Possible enhancement for auto generation

(half v )4. Textual Seminar Structure ---> Slides Seminar Structure
