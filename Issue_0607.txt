Issues 0607:
-----------------------------------------
1. Start fixing the issues in VP project

-1.1 Stickynode	-radius issues
	-We need to find where the background is colored
		-it's in the same layer of title 
	-We need to only change the bottom radius of the backgroundground
		-sovled by only changing bottom-radius

-1.2 Strong the title of new create node
	- the new node is defined in extension2 ,json 
	- the function name we would like to strong is its title
	
	-why it's not as bold as other node's title?
		-Because it's an input, it doesn't inherit the style from
		normal node_header
	
	-We should set the bold weight for all node header
	-and inherit it for input area widget
	
	-where's the title here in code?
		-I know it's defined in VPFileJson
		-how it's used and defined?
		-where's the inputarea blabla?
			-I didn' t find where the node is create and used this input area
			-but I know where the widget inputarea is, so I change the source of problem
	
	-I'll spend 10 more mins finding out where the new node is create
	-It's in nodes/CreateFunction.
	
	
-1.3 Icon size of Tooltip , 'Types not compatiable'

	-Find where the tooltip is defined
	
	-It's in useGraph.ts, 
	-good chance to continue reading useGraph from line 346 to
	where we need isValidConnection in line 446
	
#TODO: the is ValidConnection() in useGraph is read, but I'll put this aside for now and fix the 
next issue first	

-1.4	
	

2. Where to find css for Visual Programming package?
	-the VP package is a published package, we do not need to modify it anymore
	-we overwrite it in vp4 project's style

	//beside the font-family, we also need to change the font weight,font size
	[]2.1 Fontweight 
	
		-in gui/NodeLibraryItem.tsx need to change from 405 to 600
	
	
	2.2 FontSize
	
	-in Accordion Summary, we need the font size to be 12px, font-weight bold, letter-spacing 1->0px
	-in SearchBar, font-size should be 14px (it's not regualr size, it's hard code 14) 
		-Or check jp settings:
		
		--jp-ui-font-scale-factor: 1.2;
		--jp-ui-font-size0: 0.83333em;
		--jp-ui-font-size1: 13px;
		--jp-ui-font-size2: 1.2em;
		--jp-ui-font-size3: 1.44em;
	
		--jp-content-font-size0: 0.83333em;
		--jp-content-font-size1: 14px;
		--jp-content-font-size2: 1.2em;
		--jp-content-font-size3: 1.44em;
		--jp-content-font-size4: 1.728em;
		--jp-content-font-size5: 2.0736em;
	
	
	-we can use px to fix the abnormal fontSize
	
	
	
	-2.2.1 Menu font-size looks too large after changing to em
	-2.2.2 The file pool also looks too large 
	
	2.3 other css details
	
	[]-2.3.1 Accordion scroller
		-Where to add the overflow property?
			-Accordion is a MUI component
			-we test the scorller bar by setting the max-height of MuiCollapse to 80px
			-And we find out we already have scorllerbar
			-because the original .css-pwcg7p-MuiCollapse-root have overflow-auto
				-the original overflow is not auto, it's visible
		-test by seting max-height to 80px, the scroller bar is working

		-Need further test in VP4 project
		
	[]-2.3.2 Button to the right
		-after changing the parent div of two buttons as float:right
		-only the first item changes postion, why?
		-And we find out, the buttons are only at the right corner of content.
		not the border
		
		-In jupyter, it should be at the coner of the border
		for different item has different length of content
		
		-SO we add width:100% for vp-nodelibrary-entry-description
	
	[]-2.3.3 Hover Effect for buttons and font-size minor fix
		-The button's font-size is fixed to smaller version 12px(hard code)
		-The hover effect added
	
	
	
	-2.3.4 Accordion Title minor fix 
		-in Accordion Summary, we need the font size to be 12px, 
		font-weight bold, letter-spacing 1->0px
		
		
	

	

	
	//- Search bar, round corner?
	
	2.4 How to publish new package?  we'll publish later 
	
	
2.




3. In useGraph.ts, line 346, we continue reading with

-getFreeUniqueNodeIds()
// This function is to go over the current NodeId and try to find
a new unoccupied one

-addElements()
// to add new nodes or edges

//node.selected is an option for reactflow node
https://reactflow.dev/docs/api/nodes/node-options/#selected-1
-Thus, selectedNodes(), selectEdge(),clearEdgeSelection()
selectAll(), selectNode() are all modifying the selected
boolean flag for certain edges and nodes

-clear(), it setNodes([]), setEdges([]) to empty

-deleteNodes() // delete node with specific nodeId by 
//1.only setNodes without deleteNodeId
//2. set ShouldUpdateDataTypeOfRerouteNode flag as true

-deleteSelectedNodes()
// 1. deleted Edges of selectedNodesId, source and target
// 2. delete nodes 
//3. update reroute

-deleteSelectedElements()
//if edge, call deleteEdges
//if node, call deleteSelectedNodes


-deleteAllEdgesOfNode()// deleteEdges() source and target

-deleteAllEdgesOfSelectedNode() //find selected node by selectedNodes(), deleteAllEdgesOfNode()

-deleteAllEdgesOfHandle
// inputs are both nodeId and handleId
// deleteEdges(
        (e) =>
          (e.source === nodeId && e.sourceHandle === handleId) ||
          (e.target === nodeId && e.targetHandle === handleId)
      );

-We continue code reading of useGraph in line 446

-isValidConnection()
	-what's action?  What's ConnectionAction?
	
	in gui/elements/Menu.tsx 
	
	export interface IMenuItem {
	  title: string;
	  action?: () => void;
	  icon?: any;
	  subtitle?: string;
	  disabled?: boolean;
	  titleStyle?: Record<string, string>;
	}
	// we notice that action is a self-defined function in Interface ImenuItem
	
	




-------------------------------------------
Main task today:
1. Fix some small things in VP project to get back to the table 

2. Find where to modify the VP4 project's css

3. Continue the code reading from useGraph in line 346
// the most important codes in VP project are these hooks,
 useGraph and useScene
//Xiongqi








----------------------------------------------
Reading:

1. There's a new file in nodes/CreateFunction ,not sure its usage now
but looks important
