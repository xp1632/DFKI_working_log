Issues 3004:
-----------------------------------------
1. We summarize 
	- how to write unsuccessful method in thesis
	- in https://github.com/xp1632/DFKI_working_log/issues/47

2. We opened all slides and start puting shits together









-------------------------------------------
Main task today:

(v)0. Wipe the old shit and get a clean butt

My thoughts:

- One Problem left in Chaldene:
- `Tuple` related processing code adding in `Format module in JSON generation`

- One Problem left for pipeline
- How should we test visual nodes?
