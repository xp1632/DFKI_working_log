Issues 1807:
-----------------------------------------
1. In order to find how to get the nodeId of TreeItem,

we check TreeItem:  https://mui.com/material-ui/api/tree-item/

- we find out every TreeItem or StyledTreeItem has nodeId

- !We also have treeDataId in our code, this treeDataId is not what we finally
used in TreeView, it's more used in creating the Treeview

-! by checking treeViewref. current.children, we can make use of some of its props



!1.1 what the onNodeFoucus returns, is exactly nodeId, or at least id for certain node,
	The variables and Functions are set wrong as their id and name are the same, both variablles
	-while the nodeID should be nummer ids?

	-so now when we have the actually ids, how should we get the treeData accordingly?
	-we find out the id in ref.current.children is different, so we neeed to use the 
	id from focusedID, this id is consistent with the id in treeData
	

1.2 getNodeById
	-In ISceneActions, we have getNodeById
	-However, it's for reactflow's custom nodes?
 
	
1.4 Get to know TreeData
	-Now what we need to solve is :
	-we have focusedID of treeItem, we have treeData for all treeitems
	-how could we fetch the treeItemData from treeData based focusedID


1.5 Deep in SearchMenu.tsx,

 https://github.com/Max-ChenFei/VisualProgrammingEditor/issues/305#issuecomment-1640721718
	we have several sources of treeData, 
	
	-1. from commands in Search Menu

	-in SearchMenu, we have extra command for 'Add comment' node
	-we have commandsToTreeData to it
	-to transform each new add commands into treeData Array

	-We can see the nodeData we get from commands, has id the same as its name
	such as id:'Add Comment...', name:'Add Comment...'

	Add Comment.., Add Sticky Note..., Add Reroute..., Clear, Variables, Functions
	These treeData Item are normal
	
	-2. from nodeConfig in SearchedTreeView

	-also part of the items are from .nodeConfigsToTreeData in SearchedTreeView.tsx
	
!!!!	-If one command have no category,
		-then it's a solo node in treeview, without children

2. We can not make hover as selected, otherwise when we keydown the itemlist
	every item is created


3. I would like to try the Keydown for item,
	after trying, we can not add onKeydown for item
	-we need to figure out in treeview

4. At least no matter what, we know the id for each treeviem item is unique

Main task today:
1. Fix the non-match type problem in Search Menu, node creation by Enter

2. Continue the code reading in Line 446 in VP project useGraph

3. Part 1 's lebenstest question

My thoughts:

Take away:

1. In Javascript, undefined is false, !undefined is true
