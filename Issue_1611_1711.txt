Issues 1611_1711:
-----------------------------------------
1. 
eclipse doesn't have chatgpt support, if possible
	- vs code + maven+ java environment
	- choose Java 8 for JIPipe because the rest version doesn't work
	- it already comes with JRE1.8, seems to be Java 8 support
	
- how to change to java 8 in vs code?
	


2. I need to know more about Groovy https://www.tutorialspoint.com/groovy/groovy_methods.htm
- for example , how method should be used in Groovy

My thoughts:

1. how to make a plugin for fiji?
	- a jar add somewhere and a pom.xml
	- we could decompile a jar and get its java file inside 
	

2. how should we check if this plugin works in net.imagej
	- 2.1 packages matters
	- if only imageJ2 packages, definitely work
	- if import ImageJ 1.x, can't guarantee
	

	- 2.2 rely on ImageJ interface?
	- should be somewhere in the code
	
3. how do we know if a plugin is imageJ2 or ImageJ 1.x?
	- via the import?

4. ImageJ legacy, how does it work?

Take away:

- More related work of ImageJ

	- how to solve dependency
	- learn complicated usecases 
	
- we want a customized plugins working on
