-----------------------------------------
1. CV modification : 
	- I don't want spend too much time on modifying this 
	- since I still need the stupid administration process to proceed
	- I'll spend this morning + this noon 
	- and get one base academic cv, two cover letters for Philipp, KL 
	- And 

- Fei's advice of other CV
	- from current background/experience to previous
	- stress local experience
	- show programming skills with project,not with (good)
	- ungrade undesired extra credits to keep an overall good mark

1.1 Let's see what the three position require

 [KL - TrustifAI ] 






-------------------------------------------
Main task today:

(v) 1. Wrap up seminar materials

2. Registration of thesis
	- I've sent the email to require BMS certificate
	- I've sent the registration form to asr and Philipp
	
	- After I get a certificate and a signed form
	- I'll contact lorang of other staffs in exam office
	- as said in https://www.ps-mint.uni-saarland.de/en/guidelines/cs/thesis_registration
	
	- if Possible, I'll request for ungraded the extra credits I get
	- by credits regulation https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/study/programmes/master/media-informatics.html
	- And only keep these courses as graded

	```
	- **2 Core courses** : (Human Computer Interaction 1.3), (Image Processing and Computer Vision 3.0)  (18Credits)   
	- **1 advanced lecture** (The Elements of Statistical Learning 3.0) (6Credits)
	- **1 seminar** (Attentive User Interfaces 1.7) (7Credits)
	- **1 MAD project** (Briefing Machine 1.0) (8Credits)
	- **1 Master Seminar** (New Attempt in 2024,DFKI 1.0) (12Credits)
	- **1 Master Thesis**
	- **1 Internship Seminar**  (2.3) (5Credits)

	- Details in your Obsidian purple notebook 
	- You can print it down and go to examination on Thursday 
	- Friday is holiday

3. CV modification

- originally we have a web developer CV
- now we need a cv that we can use to apply for an phd candidate

- And for cover letter(200-300 words), you can write an initial version.
- since the transcript is not that fast


(v)4. Wrap up the Position information for KL-healthcare AI
https://github.com/xp1632/DFKI_working_log/issues/35
 
- I try to scan the pytorch things fast, and I found out that I don't quite understand 
the code
- But I understand the most basic mechanism:
- training a (Neural Network)equation based on the data we have,
- and try to predict the result we expected by find a proper set of parameters
-  that minimized loss in loss functions



----------------------------------------------
My thoughts:

1. To fix the missing background of trustAI part:
	
	- I'll take several advanced courses from April
	
		- Topics in Algorithmic Data Analysis https://eda.rg.cispa.io/edu/tada24
		- Attacks Against Ml models	https://cms.cispa.saarland/amlm2024/
---
	- Trustworthy Generative Machine Learning 
		- This topic is relevant but it's student-based seminar
		- I don't want to do pre or listen to bad pre
		
- I've added my interested courses in the calendar
