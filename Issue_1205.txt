Issues 1205:
-----------------------------------------
1. Check the theme in MUI, because we've met it twice in project
	https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/theming/#themeprovider
	https://mui.com/material-ui/experimental-api/css-theme-variables/usage/
	
	ThemeProvider should be the parent of the components you are trying to customize
		-didn't look too deeper, just for understanding the usage
		
	-theme.palette defines the color theme https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/palette/
	-theme.typography defines the font family and font size https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/typography/
	-theme.spacing defines the space unit, default 1 spacing = 8 pixel https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/spacing/
	-theme.breakpoints defines different screen size(xs,sm,md,lg,xl) for responsive design https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/breakpoints/
	-theme.z-index defines a third axis to arrange content https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/z-index/
	-theme.transition defines simple interactive animation for components https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/transitions/
	-theme.components, we can define default style for each components https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/theme-components/
	
	-Nest theme:
	Innertheme would override outer Theme when themes are nested
	
	-useTheme hook, we can use hook useTheme inside the components:
		function DeepChild() {
		  const theme = useTheme();
		  return <span>{`spacing ${theme.spacing}`}</span>;
		}
	
2.Check Accordion: https://mui.com/material-ui/react-accordion/
	
-Acoordion consists of <AccordionSummary> as item title
					<AccordionDetails> as item content
	2.1 The Accordion Component in NodeLibraryList.tsx	is styled <MuiAccordion>
	
3. Modify AccordionSummary(Title)
	-remove the background color in the theme of styled AccordionSummary
	-modify the Icon of expansion from ArrowForward to PlayArrowIcon
		-slight modify the width of icon later
	-change the letter space of font
		-1px
	-change the font of title 
		-Jupyter used font apple 12.5px, we used Roboto 12.5
	-Add hover effect for Title 
	-change the left padding of title or Icon
		-the padding of icon is set as 8px
	-remove the right border,right border in the theme
	
	-Why is this title so tall in height?
		We have disableGutters prop in MUIAccordion, could it be the reason?
		-No.
		
		The height is becase the AccordionDetails is that tall
		The Title keeps the height from the item. Yes, they are both 947px x 64
		
		Why?
		in the Customization example :https://mui.com/material-ui/react-accordion/
		The Title doesn't have the same height with the content
		
		-The default minHeight from the MUI css is 48px
		 we changed it to 20px and set the currentHeight to 32px
	

	
4. Modify the bottom border of the items in the panel <AccordionDetails> (Content)
			Where's the bottom border?
			The bottom border is defined in another file
			NodeLibraryItem.tsx
			The structure is <AccordionDetails> --> <NodeLibraryItem>

5. Modify the search bar
	in SearchInput.tsx,change the width to 100%
	change the border
	-if we should move the place of Icon to the right, later

6. Modify the NodeLibraryItem's title,description, button

	for button, we need to define hover effect
-------------------------------------------
Main task today:

1.Finish checking MUI.theme
2.Check Accordion Components

3. Modify NodeExtension Layout
	-Mock the style of jupyter extension side bar
	-pay attention to if the content looks the same when in the page and when in sidebar
		The Divider Component's width should be '100%'
		The MenuItem's width is flexiable and the content in it is auto
		We don't have a ICON for package, do we need one?
	
	-The color of the menuitem title is not correct
	-The color of the menuitem discription is not correct
	-The color of divider line is not correct
	
	-The icon/font of 'Installed' is not the same
		
	-The button should be no border, no default color, with hover effect
	
	-The transition speed of jupyter is 0s
	
	-The 'install' button needs more padding and no border 
	
	-The search bar is a part of this, it also needs modification
		-but we'll start from the accordion 
		-The border of search bar should be 4 ways and flex to whole page

--------------------------------------------
Take away:
1. we create a mui theme with help of this tool: 
https://zenoo.github.io/mui-theme-creator/

2. Innertheme would override outer Theme when themes are nested

3. We can use hook useTheme inside the components:
function DeepChild() {
  const theme = useTheme();
  return <span>{`spacing ${theme.spacing}`}</span>;
}

4.When testing with random numbers, test both largest and smallest

--------------------------
Next Week:

1. Remove Round corner of drop and drag file opened

2. encapsule our code 
3. How to use other people's code, set clear boundary between our code and others
 set a specific interface to use third-party function
 
Button,event, passing props
