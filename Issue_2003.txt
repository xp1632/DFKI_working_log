Issues 2003:
-----------------------------------------
1. Fei's feedback

- I've already fixed all the minor parts
- And I've summarized the important modifications in 
https://github.com/xp1632/DFKI_working_log/issues/30#issuecomment-2009454326
- the v3 slides are also there


2. My Modification

- Now we only have Python kernel, java kernel instead of `Ipython kernel`


3. Segmentation workflow video editing

- I'll write the scripts down for the video:

---

 - S1: This is a video showcase for the ImageJ Cell Segmentation Workflow, integrated in Chaldene System
 
 - S2: First we read an 3d microscopy image: "test_cells3d", and slice the 2d image we need 
 
 - S3: we can preview the image slice by clicking the image handle then clicking `watch this image`
 
 - S4: Here's the cell slice image we get, the preview on the node panel is shown without color mapping
  
 - S5: and the image shown in the following jupyter cell is with color mapping and all other detailed information
 
 - S6: Then we create an edge-preserve_smoothing node through the search menu
 
 - S7: This is exactly what we want, the inner side of cells are more smooth now

 - S8: we search for the O T S U segmentation, and we link the node with edges

- S9: however, while the segmentation result is pretty good, but it's not perfect enough

- S10: there are some missing holes inside the cells

- S11: gladly, we can easily fix that by morphology filters: dilation and filling holes

- S12: voila, after applying these two plugins, now we segmented the cells perfectly from the background



-------------------------------------------
Main task today:

(v)1. add two pages based on Fei's 2nd feedback

2. Listen to practice 1 and practice 2, write scripts

3. Edit the cell segmentation video clips, shorter and AI voice subtitle

4. Go through the live generation process again, to see the pace we want

5. One practice with scripts and one without
 



----------------------------------------------
My thoughts:

customizing a certain part of workflow requires a certain level of knowledge in script editing.
