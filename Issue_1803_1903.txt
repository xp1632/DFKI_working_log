Issues 1803_1903:
-----------------------------------------
### let's first modify the existing slides

[v] 1. In Slide 2 [Background - Fiji], advertise more about Fiji
	[v]- tell more about its material sciences/ astronomy field community
 	[v]- and more than 30000 people(no source) who are using Fiji 800+ plugins
	- we found the source for 25000 user in 2012,but we don't find new data source, so we don't use it


[v] 1.5 In Slide 3 Background - Chaldene,
	[v] Fixed the remaining border of the visual node when removing background

[v] 2. In Slide 3 [Background - Chaldene], add two explanatory sentences
	- about what is VP workflow, what is visual node
	- visual node is functioning backended by node specification json file
	(v)- don't mention hiwi work

[v] 3. In Slide 4 [Motivation -Comparison]
	(v)- In both sides,remove the [user friendly] comparison since its not our main focus
	- In Fiji side, illstrate more on `hard to share workflow`
	(v)	a. Add [Inconvenience in Macro recorder to reproduce workflow]: 
	(in script)	- still requires knowledge of scripts editing
	(in script)	- works for exact obejct in exact order, hard to extend 
	- In Chaldene side, illstrate more `easy to share and visualize`
	(v)	a. Add [Visual Automation Workflow] 
	(in slide 5)	b. Add [Digital Sustainbility], [Scientific reproducibility]

[v] 4. In Slide 5[Motivation - Integration]
	(v)- Fix the green-yellow color contrast issue by adjust position
	(v)- add Add [Digital Sustainbility], [Scientific reproducibility]
	- add `first step` and modify the challenges to state why`jupyter`
	- What's our selling point for IJ+VP?
		- Visual,reproduciable automation flow, out of confined imageJ
	(v)- add one sentence illustration from integration in Chaldene to integrate in Jupyter


[v]	5. In Slide 6: Adjust the shadow or not? (No)
	
	
[v]	6. In Slide 8 
	- Add `first step`, `next step`
	- Modify into more clear statement: 
		- How to handle Java-based ImageJ  and Python-based Chaldene in the same Jupyter environment?
		- Multi-kernels handling multi-languages in the same notebook

[v] 7. In Slide 10 [Methodology – Polyglot Notebook]
	- Add `new question`


----
### Let's add slides

[v] 1. In slide 28 [Conclusion]
	- what do we want to conclude?
	- what do we want to stress again an let the audience take home with
		- we want to let the audience know
		1. what problems we solved?
		2. by what means
		3. what will this solution bring us
	
 2. In Slide 29 [Next Step]
	- say it in a more abstract level
	- mention that we'll do some wrap work for the automation pipeline
	- might wrap it into a special GUI in Chaldene
	- And for Knowledge Graph part, also an important part of Chaldene,
	- the only reason we didn't touch it now is that this part of project is still
	in progress by other group members, we want to integrate our part of work later.

### Scripts

1.[Slide 2: Background - ImageJ/Fiji]
	- More stress more on why Fiji is super cool and why we want to integrate it
	- 
2.[Slide 3: Background - Chaldene]
	- Add some explanation of Chaldene interface : 
		- input, handle, node, search menu etc.
	- add two explanatory sentences
		- about what is VP workflow, what is visual node
		- visual node is functioning backended by node specification json file

### Script Draft:

1. old: combination and advantages we get from integration

- Combines the robust functionalities of ImageJ with the user-friendly interface of Chaldene
---------------
Allows users to leverage the ImageJ functions they are already familiar with in a new tool
Facilitates easy sharing and reproduction of workflows via Chaldene
Enhances the accessibility of image processing tools for scientists with limited programming experience
Expand the boundary for ImageJ users to explore and utilize other libraries instead of confining to ImageJ’s Java Ecosystem

-------------------------------------------
Main task today:

(v) 1. Microsoft 365 membership
(v)2. Modify the feedback parts and have a version 2
(v)3. Finish the conclusion part and next step part
